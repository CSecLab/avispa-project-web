    <h2>The AVISPA tool</h2>
    
    
   The AVISPA tool version 1.1 has been released (June 30, 2006) and
   can be downloaded <a href=download.html>here</a>.

   
    <h2>SPAN, the Security Protocol ANimator for AVISPA</h2>

   <font color="#FF0000" size=+2><b>NEW!</b></font><br> 

   SPAN is designed to help protocol developers in writing HLPSL
   specifications. From an HLPSL specification SPAN helps in
   interactively buiding Message Sequence Charts (MSC) of the protocol
   execution. Since SPAN implements an active intruder, it can also be
   used to interactively find and build attacks over protocols.

<!--     The web-based interface of the Avispa Tool is currently down for maintenance. Sorry for that. -->

     <p>
	     A <a href="https://www.docker.com/">docker</a>-based tool chain for running the AVISPA tool directly in
      your environment is also available.
	     You can find a unix shell script <a href="orchestrator.sh" target=_blank>here</a>.

      <p>
      Please notice that the docker tool chain is still under development and testing. Please report bugs and issues.

<!--     The web-based interface of the Avispa Tool is currently down for maintenance. Sorry for that. -->

     <p>
      A web-based interface for running the AVISPA tool directly in
      your browser is also available <a
      href=web-interface
      target=_blank>here</a>.

      <p>
      Please notice that the web interface is for demonstration
      purposes only.  If you plan to make an intensive use of the
      AVISPA web interface (e.g. for a practical in a course), please
      <a href=web_interface.tgz target=_blank>download</a> and install
      on a local machine the code of the web-based interface.

    <h3>The HLPS2IF translator</h3>

<!--     HLPSL2IF is our translator from the High Level Protocol -->
<!--     Specification Language (HLPSL) to the Intermediate Format (IF). -->
<!--     Please read the file <a href=HLPSL2IF/README>README</a> for more -->
<!--     information, and click on <a href=HLPSL2IF/hlpsl2if>hlpsl2if</a> -->
<!--     for getting a copy of the executable file.   -->
    <p>
    The HLPSL is an expressive, modular, role-based, formal language
    that allows for the specification of control flow patterns,
    data-structures, alternative intruder models, complex security
    properties, as well as different cryptographic primitives and
    their algebraic properties.  These features make HLPSL well suited
    for specifying modern, industrial-scale protocols.  Moreover, the
    HLPSL enjoys both a declarative semantics based on a fragment of
    the Temporal Logic of Actions and an operational semantics based
    on a translation into the rewrite-based formalism Intermediate
    Format IF.  
    </p>
    <p>
    HLPSL2IF automatically translates HLPSL specifications into
    equivalent IF specifications which are in turn fed to the
    back-ends.
    </p>
    <p>
    HLPSL2IF is part of the AVISPA Tool v1.0 and is written in OCAML,
    a freely-distributed object-oriented version of ML which you can
    obtain at <a href=http://www.ocaml.org
    target=_blank>http://www.ocaml.org</a>. 
    </p>

    <h3>The AVISPA backends</h3>

    AVISPA employs four tools to tackle validation of security
    protocols. 

  <ul>
  <li> 
  The <a href=http://compute.dtu.dk/~samo/
  target=_blank>On-the-fly Model-Checker</a> (OFMC) performs protocol
  falsification and bounded verification by exploring the transition
  system described by an IF specification in a demand-driven way. OFMC
  implements a number of correct and complete symbolic techniques.  It
  supports the specification of algebraic properties of cryptographic
  operators, and typed and untyped protocol models.
  </li> 
  <li> 
  The <a href=http://www.loria.fr/equipes/cassis/softwares/AtSe
  target=_blank>Constraint-Logic-based Attack Searcher</a> (CL-AtSe)
  applies constraint solving with some powerful simplification
  heuristics and redundancy elimination techniques.  CL-AtSe is built
  in a modular way and is open to extensions for handling algebraic
  properties of cryptographic operators. It supports type-flaw
  detection and handles associativity of message concatenation.
  </li> 
  <li> 
  The <a href=http://www.ai-lab.it/satmc
  target=_blank>SAT-based Model-Checker</a> (SATMC) builds a
  propositional formula encoding a bounded unrolling of the transition
  relation specified by the IF, the initial state and the set of
  states representing a violation of the security properties.  The
  propositional formula is then fed to a state-of-the-art SAT solver
  and any model found is translated back into an attack.
  </li> 
  <li> 
  The <a href=http://lifc.univ-fcomte.fr/~boichut/TA4SP/TA4SP.html
  target=_blank>Tree Automata based on Automatic Approximations for
  the Analysis of Security Protocols</a> (TA4SP) back-end approximates
  the intruder knowledge by using regular tree languages and
  rewriting.  For secrecy properties, TA4SP can show whether a
  protocol is flawed (by under-approximation) or whether it is safe
  for any number of sessions (by over-approximation).
  </li>
  </ul>
