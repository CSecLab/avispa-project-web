<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> I have also used SATMC and the result is the same with CL-ATSE. 
</I>
Well, there is an attack to your protocol...

As noted in the Clark-Jacob library, there are two kinds of attacks
known on Andrew Secure RPC, namely a replay and a parallel session
attack. The parallel session attack is still possible with your
modification. 

The problem is that it is not covered by the session instances you have
specified, i.e. you did not consider the situation
  composition
           andrewSRPC(a,b,kab,succ)
        /\ andrewSRPC(b,a,kab,succ)

(and then you can find this attack with all back-ends)

I know that going through all kinds of scenarios manually is very
awkward, but we have installed in OFMC a feature to do that
symbolically, i.e. you specify several sessions but with variables for
the agent names. Unfortunately, you can use this feature only through
the Intermediate Format, as HLPSL does not allow symbolic initial states
and you also get into trouble when using functions for key-tables (which
you of course need to say what the shared key of A and B is). 

&gt;<i> 12  (b,4) -&gt; i:  {n5(Na)}_n11(Kab)
</I>&gt;<i> 13   i -&gt; (b,4):  {{n5(Na)}_succ}_n11(Kab)
</I>
I suppose CL-AtSe has the property {{M}K_1}K_2 = {{M}K_2}K_1 built in
for symmetric cryptography. Also in CL-AtSe function application is
handled by a hack, namely using symmetric encryption, that's why you
have this strange &quot;encryption&quot; with the &quot;hash-function&quot; called &quot;succ&quot;.
That's should be the reason for this nonsensical attack.

Btw: in OFMC you can specify your own algebraic theories, like the above
property (which is not part of the standard built-in theory that is used
when you call OFMC without the &quot;-theory&quot; option).

Regards,
Sebastian
