<PRE>Hi,

 &gt; I have a question regarding the intruder knowledge function(iknows).
 &gt; 
 &gt; My protocol has a symmetic key K_ENC known by A and B.
 &gt; I want to verify that my protocol is working, as spesified.
 &gt; So I tried to introduce iknows(K_ENC) into the protocol.
 &gt; 
 &gt; But avispa does not find an attack trace, although  the encryption key
 &gt; is known to the intruder.
 &gt; 
 &gt; How is that possible?
 &gt; 
 &gt; The goal of secrecy of K_icc and K_ifd sould also be broken, right?


Yes, sure. But there are some mistakes in your protocol specification
that prevent the protocol from being executable:

- in the first transition of role bob, the value Rnd_icc should be
learned from the incoming message. Thus, you should replace in this
transition all occurrences of Rnd_icc with Rnd_icc' 

-&gt; after this change an attack is found by the avispa tool

- you should do this for other variables too, e.g. K_ifd and
Rnd_ifd, otherwise you get an attack with lots of &quot;dummy_nonce&quot;
because you are using uninitialized variables.

- in role session you probably mean &quot;bob(A,B,...)&quot; rather than
&quot;bob(B,A,...)&quot;

- also note that you declare that all agents are using the same shared
key, i.e. session(a,b,k_enc,k_mac...)  session(a,i,k_enc,k_mac) etc.
That's probably not what you want.

- Also I have seen that you have declared a variable M_icc:text, but
then assign a composed value to it. You should rather use a composed
type or simply M_icc:message. (Note that the typed models in protocol
analysis in general are quite different from type systems in
functional programming languages.)

That's all the mistakes I have spotted by looking at it, hope this is
helpful. In general, my suggestion is to use the executability checks
and even the step-by-step simulation of the protocol to convince
yourself that your specification is what you want.

Ciao,
Sebastian

</PRE>
