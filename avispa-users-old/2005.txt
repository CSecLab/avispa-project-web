I have been playing with AVISPA for the past few days. Overall my
impressions are very positive. It is a great piece of software, the
installation is painless, the documentation is good and overall I found
it a lot easier to use than some of the other tools in the same space.

I do, however, have a few gripes:

* The xemacs mode. It does a great job of syntax highlighting. However,
it is suffering from the following shortcomings/bugs:
  - no indentation support
  - the buffer refresh in the compile cycle is erratic - sometimes the
result buffers refresh automatically, sometimes they don't, and at other
times I get duplicate buffers (..<2> etc)
  - the compilation does not report any errors; one can find them by
switching to the compilation buffer, but that is not at all obvious
  - the error locations in the compilation buffer are not of a format
that emacs recognises, which makes navigating to error locations
difficult


* Non-executable models. As mentioned in the manual & tutorial, and
evidenced by my own observations, it is very easy to make mistakes that
result in the model becoming partially un-executable and the model
checker consequently reporting success. The tutorial suggests using the
-p option to step through the states. However, that is extremely tedious
for anything but the most trivial models.

Would it be possible to perform an automated check that all transitions
in a model are reachable and can fire? That, I think, would catch most
of the cases of non-executable models.


* Secure channels. Currently, the only type of channel supported by the
modelling language are Dolev-Yao channels. For modelling complex systems
I find myself wanting to decompose roles into smaller entities but since
the insecure D-Y channels are the only form of communication available
this introduces spurious vulnerabilities.

The same problem arises more generally when trying to model systems
where parts of the communication are impervious to attack. Would it be
possible to introduce a secure channel type?


* Web interface. The downloadable distribution of AVISPA does not appear
to contain the web interface and the trace->msc converter. Would it be
possible to make these available?


* Typed vs un-typed. In a number of cases I encountered models where I
though an attack was possible but AVISPA declared the protocol safe. On
closer inspection that turned out to be due to types. In one example
there was a replay attack possible if a text type could be interpreted
as a symmetric key type. Whether that attack is possible in reality
depends on the crypto used. Turning off type-checking resulted in the
attack being found. It's probably worth pointing that out in the
manual/tutorial.

Matthias

Message-ID: <002901c58d5f$b21c3610$0200a8c0@bensmyth>

Dear AVISPA users,

I am currently working with AVISPA and would like to make a suggestion for
future development.

My work requires more than the basic functions that AVISPA provides (such as xor
and exp), thus supporting user-defined functions would be highly desirable.

According to the documentation it would appear that this is already possible, by
editing the prelude.if file, however this seems not to be the case. SATMC
appears to be the only translator which uses the prelude.if file, all other back
ends simply ignore it? Thus making it impossible to define one's own functions?
If this is not the case I would be grateful if you could provide me with further
information.

Further to the above comment I would like to add; the prelude.if file is not the
best place to put user-defined functions (for numerous reasons, which I won't go
into here - although feel free to ask). Ideally I would suggest the inclusion of
the keyword import/include within the hlpsl specification, which defines the
inclusion of a user-defined prelude (in addition to the default prelude.if).
Alternatively the additional prelude could be specified at the command line. Or
both options could be incorporated. Personally I would prefer the include/import
option.


Regards,

Ben Smyth

Dear Ben,

I am going to answer to you as developer of SATMC and in name of the
AVISPA team.  The idea behind the prelude file has been quite
controversal during the project.

At the beginning we have in mind what you are saying that is to allow
the user to modify the prelude file as he prefers.  Then we figure out
this was not so simple for the majority of the modules (translator and
back-ends) in the AVISPA tool and thus we decide to not allow the user
to change the prelude file i.e. the translator and the back-ends
assume what there is written in the prelude file.  So you may ask why
to introduce a prelude file and I would say for making explicit the
assumption made.  

SATMC (and maybe TA4SP) are the only back-ends that currently process
the prelude file, but I am afraid they both do not support equations.
We would like extend SATMC with algebraic equations and we plan to
work on it in September (a preliminary work in this direction was
started one year ago, but afterthat we did not have resources for
continuing it). 

On the one hand I agree with you that the tool should be extended for
allowing users to specify their own equational theory, goal facts,
etc.  On the other it is not so obvious to implement a back-end able
to consider a generic equational theory.  I am quite sure that on this
specific point my project colleagues at INRIA and ETHZ are more
prepared than me and so I would invite them to express their opinions.

This is a good suggestion and I agree with you that it would be a nice
improvement of the AVISPA tool.

P.S. next week the majority of the AVISPA members (me included) will
be quite busy for the project evaluation meeting.  After that I will
be willing to continue this discussion.

Driven by your suggestions, we have been doing many improvements
to the XEmacs mode:
- more support for semantics errors,
- automatic splitting of the XEmacs window in two buffers
   (specification and compilation) during compilation;
- a more rational navigation through error locations

All of these improvements will be available in the next release of
the Avispa Tool for sure.

In fact, there already are two tools that can perform such a check:

OFMC has the option "sessco" (User-manual, section 3.2.2) which tries
to find a trace where all participants reach their final state. This
is not possible for protocols with any kinds of loops (as then there
is no such final state). Also, in the case that the protocol is not
executable and there is no trace where all agents reach their final
state, OFMC cannot give a hint where it failed. Anyway, if the
protocol is executable, you don't have to trace through the search
space with the -p option.

Also, SATMC has an option to check executability of single rules.
It can be enabled by using the option

"check_only_executability=true"

We'll surely think about making these checks automatic.

Yes, this would be a useful feature.  Unfortunately, it's rather complex, both 
theoretically and in terms of actually implementing it. We've been working on 
a framework for introducing different channels types that we hope will be as 
general as possible.  Instead of extending the system each time we want a new 
channel type, we'd like a general way of describing what capabilities an 
intruder can have on a channel and then be able to give a new channel type 
simply by describing a combination of those capabilities.  This is in the 
pipeline but will require quite a bit of work, so for the immediate future I'm 
afraid the only option is to specify such "secure" communication as happening 
within a monolithic role.

There is no particular problem with that. I believe we will soon make
the whole web interface available for download (as a separate package).
By the way, it is likely that we will release also a new version
of the avispa tool with minor corrections and improvements within
this year. Further strategies for managing future releases of the
tool are still under discussion.

Jacopo.

Excellent. I am looking forward to using that. Are you planning to add
indentation support?

I didn't realise -sessco could be used to check executability. I've
tried it now, and it does indeed work. Not getting any hint as to where
it failed is, of course, somewhat unhelpful. There is also one other
problem: Executability is checked in the presence of the intruder. In
some of the examples I had tried before, the protocol itself wasn't
executable due to mismatches in the send/receive patterns. However,
since an intruder can construct messages, the protocol does become
executable in the presence of an intruder and hence -sessco does not
report any problems.

The user manual doesn't mention this option. I have just tried it and it
does identify the non-executability problems I have encountered so far,
including the one I mention above. Great!

Does this check cope with (some) loops?

I can see how the general framework would be useful, but also a lot of
work, as you say. Perhaps you could consider an interim solution where
you just get secure channels to work. Or would that be almost as hard as
the general solution?

Message-ID: <f600cdae3de2d.43188ecb@gmu.edu>

Hi there:

Is there anyone who is using AVISPA? I have two questions about it.

First, when I used the on-line version of AVISPA, and tried to analyze SSL, the IE had no response for about half an hour. I don't know whether it will take so much time to analyze? 

Second, I copied the HLPSL file of NSPK protocol from the D2.1 downloaded from the website and try to analyze it on the web tool, it shows an error: 

AVISPA Web Tool
===============

The HLPSL2IF translator is reporting the following error:

%% Translation of /home/avispa/web-interface-computation/./tempdir/workfileVSeQ3O
%% Syntax error: Line 1, Col 4 (offset 6-8, string "Ace")
%%   Syn.Err(37): missing constant identifier
     

And the first line of my file is : role Ace (A, B: agent,

I just don't know why it is wrong?

Is there someone who can give me advices?

Thanks in advance!

Are you using the expert mode or the basic one? If you are using the
basic one, then I think
you will receive an answer only after all the AVISPA backends have
completed their analysis. 
I would suggest to you to use the expert mode or, even better, to
download the tool so to run
it on your machine.

For sure the role names should be in capital letters. I guess the
version of the NSPK in D2.1
is out-of-date (many things have changed in the HLPSL language since the
delivery of D2.1)
and that is why the HLPSL2IF translator provides an error. I would
suggest to you to have a
look to the on-line HLPSL specifications (there are plenty included the
NSPK):

Message-ID: <200509070736.j877akbq027787@armandobook.mrg.dist.unige.it>

Dear all,

also this year the University of Genova has created a number of grants
for prospective PhD students.  These grants are reserved for foreigners.
The grants are for 3 months and they are seen as a means to identify
common interests between the prospective PhD students and the host
research group.  There is *no* commitment (from either side) to continue
the collaboration into a PhD, even though clearly this is the expected
result.  The candidate should have already a degree that entitles
him/her to undertake a PhD program.  The University of Genova has a long
record of international PhD programs in co-tutoring, e.g. PhD involving
a tutor from UniGe and one from a foreign institution.

The grants are meant to support the developement of a small reasearch
project on one of the following topics:

1. Automatic Analysis of Security Protocols
2. Software Model Checking

The deadline for application is unfortunately very tight (i.e. end of
September), so interested candidates should contact me as soon as
possible.

Best Regards,

alessandro

Subject: [Avispa-users] working with sets
Message-ID: <iss.bb8178fe.153e.4337cd07.dbf9.be@mailout.lrz-muenchen.de>


Hi All,

I have a short question about sets:
I know how to search in a set and how to initialize it. But, how can I update a value in a set?
For example, if I have:

KeyRing : (agent.symmetric_key.text) set

it is initialized in the environment role with:
init KeyRing = {c.k_cs.data_c, i.k_is.data_i}

and in one of the agent roles I would like to update the value of data_c
How can I do this?

thanks in advance

greetings,
Tseno

Hi Tseno,

There is no special instruction for updating a value in a set.
But you can easily do it by combining de deletion and an addition.

For example, you can write:

  ...
  /\ in(C.K_CS.D1',KeyRing)
  =|>
  ...
  /\ KeyRing':=delete(C.K_CS.D1',KeyRing)
  /\ D2' := data_c2
  /\ KeyRing':=cons(C.K_CS.D2',KeyRing)

In this example (based on yours), the "in" predicate in the left-hand
side permits to check that the element to change really exists.
In the right-hand side, there is the deletion of the existing element,
and the addition of the new one.

Note that in this example, I have assumed that C and K_CS are known by
the agent, and that the third component was unknown (so written D1').
This was just for avoiing a too simple example... ;)

Does this example fully solve your problem?

Best,
Laurent.

PS: You can also replace the last two lines of the example by:
  /\ KeyRing':=cons(C.K_CS.data_c2,KeyRing)

Dear Meron,

We did not model any onion router protocol yet.
This is indeed a very interesting challenge, but I guess that for this
you have to face the problem of specifying a dynamic network, right?
(no predefined number of nodes)

You can ask this question to the users mailing list of the AVISPA tool
(avispa-users@avispa-project.org) in case someone has already tried to
do this.

Sincerely,

Laurent.

Subject: [Avispa-users] General questions about the output
Message-ID: <BAY104-DAV724B5B51CDD8ECA52BDC4CF6F0@phx.gbl>

Hi,

I am trying to write the model of SPLICE/AS protocol. In expert mode, when I execute the OFMConly I have received the following attack:

ATTACK TRACE
i -> (c,3): start
(c,3) -> i: c.s.N1(1)
i -> (a,13): c.i.N1(1)
(a,13) -> i: a.{a.c.N1(1).ki}_inv(ka)
i -> (c,3): a.{a.c.N1(1).ki}_inv(ka)
(c,3) -> i: c.s.{c.T(3).lt.{N2(3)}_ki}_inv(kc)
i -> (a,13): i.c.x66
(a,13) -> i: a.{a.i.x66.kc}_inv(ka)
i -> (i,17): N2(3)
i -> (i,17): N2(3)

Now, I have some questions:

1. Is this possible to get multiple attack traces (if they exist) for one specification? 

2. What is the meaning of 3 in (c,3)? Does it mean the 3rd session or anything else? And why this number is dicrete like 3, 13,17..?

3. What is the meaning of 1 in N1(1)?  

4. In this attack trace, the last two messages are quite redundant. Otherwise, this is a successfull attack. Anybody any clue about it?

Thank you for your understanding. I am really interested in using AVISPA and I have found this one of the best tools for security protocols.

This is not possible as the tools stop the search at the first attack
they find, and continuing the search might just result in lots of
variants of basically the same attack. I recommend that you drop the
goal that was found violated (e.g. authentication in one direction),
to see if the other goals of the protocol do hold.

Yes they are session numbers, their choice has technical reasons.

These are also minor technical issues, sorry. (For question 3., the
reason is to create unique terms for fresh nonces, and for question
4., the redundancy has to do with the attack predicates.)

The manuals/guides that you can download as part of the avispa tool
should contain all the information that is necessary to work with the
tools, however if there are questions that are not addressed, the user
forum is the right place to ask them.

Thanks for your interest!

Hi Oliver,

David has referred me to you regarding a verification of the onion
routing protocol.  Have you done something similar to this?  If so what
were your findings?  I am looking to verify a protocol named Tor (a
second generation onion routing protocol) using the AVISPA framework.  I
appreciate any help you may be able to provide.

Thanks,
Meron

Back in July we discussed several improvements to the avispa tools, and
Jacopo mentioned that a new release was scheduled for later this
year.

Is that going to happen anytime soon?

I have just started work on a project on which I want to use avispa, and
would love to use an improved version if one is about to become
available.

Dear Salekul,

The OFMC -sessco option searches for replay attacks and checks whether 
all states are reachable. Given what you have said I assume you are 
using OFMC to see if the model is executable? The error message would 
suggest that some transitions in your protocol cannot be reached.

You may be interested in the following code if you want to search for 
replay attacks (without the sessco option):

role environment()
def=

    ...

    composition
       session(a,b)
    /\ session(a,b)

end role

With regards my previous response I was not trying to sound patronising 
by suggesting you read the manual. It is a necessity, if you wish to be 
able to understand the tool. With reference to the notation (a,5) the 
letter refers to a role (eg. alice) and the number is a session number 
(in this case 5). The session number is used internally by AVISPA and 
you can simply ignore it.


Regards,

Ben

It may be worth including the documentation included in the download

Dear Wilfred,

You can find several not yet specified protocols in the file named
Deliverable 6.1, accessible from the AVISPA library web page:
		http://www.avispa-project.org/library/

If you can specify and study some of them (or some others), we would
be very happy to add them in the AVISPA library.

Best regards,
Laurent.

You may want to have a look at SPORE (Security Protocol Open Repository)
http://www.lsv.ens-cachan.fr/spore/

There you may find some protocols that are not yet included in the library.

Hi All,

I am a new user to Avispa tool. I was trying to execute a HLPSL code of 
a network protocol.

The first output for the code was:
AVISPA Tool Summary
OFMC: UNSAFE    CL-AtSe: UNSAFE    SATMC: SAFE      TA4SP: INCONCLUSIVE

After some modifications of the protocol, such as managing the witness 
and request commands well, I got the following o/p:
AVISPA Tool Summary
OFMC: SAFE    CL-AtSe: Error     SATMC: SAFE     TA4SP: Error

If anyone has come across similar kind of execution problem, please 
share your experience with me.

thanks in advance,
Anil

Anil,

It would appear that you are using the web interface 
(http://www.avispa-project.org/web-interface/) it is possible to 
download and run AVISPA locally. I would recommend this if you plan to 
use the tool seriously.

As for the messages you are receiving
OFMC    : SAFE
CL-AtSe : SAFE
SATMC   : SAFE
TA4SP   : SAFE

OFMC, CL-AtSe, SATMC and TA4SP simply refer to the backend in use. The 
online tool will attempt to execute your protocol with each backend in turn.

If you download the tool it will come complete with documentation, which 
provides a good starting point for understaning the tool and will 
include further explanation.


Regards,

Ben

Dear Ben,

following your suggestion, we've put the documentation
of the avispa tool online, in pdf format.
It now lives at

http://www.avispa-project.org/publications.html

Thank you, and sorry for the delayed reply!

Best regards,

Jacopo.

Hi guys,
I attempted to use the web-based interface serveral times but the 
web-based interface is no longer working. I mean if you run any 
protocol, its giving the foll message:

AVISPA Web Tool
===============
The HLPSL2IF translator is reporting the following error:
Secure connection to 130.251.7.42 refused

Any one has got a clue for this problem,

Anil

Dear Anil,
you are right. During the night the machine used to run the AVISPA modules
(back-ends and translator) crashed.  We are re-started the machine and now
it seems to work again. 

We will try to investigate what happened to the machine and in any case we
will monitor its behaviour.  Please continue inform us if something weird
happens.

Thanks a lot for the collaboration!

Dear Anil,
as Ben was saying it is definetely better to use the AVISPA package for
making tests. 
The web interface should just be thought as a mode to get the feeling of
the AVISPA
tool.  For instance,  the resources (memory and time) assigned to each
test are
significantly limited on the web interface machine so to avoid memory
swap and similar.

A part from this, I would be interesting in knowing whether you have
understood why the
backends return different answers.  If you have not, maybe you could
share your HLPSL
specification with us so that we can work together to understand the
reasons.

Best regards,
Luca

Hi Guys,
I was trying to execute my HLPSL code on Linux machine.

When I give the command:  ./avispa filename.hlpsl --ofmc

At first, the HLPSL code was throwing attacks. But when I have just 
modified the intruder knowledge parameters (I removed a few 
parameters), the program was not responding (and after that the program 
crashes). I always get the following message:

% OFMC
% Version of 2005/06/07
SUMMARY


Can anyone tell whats going on the backend of my machine. To tell you, 
I have like 60MB of free space on my hard-disk. Is this because of that 
or is it anything else going on.


Anil

Subject: [Avispa-users] An invitation to contribute to my research
Message-ID: <4384A233.3000203@eti.pg.gda.pl>

Hi,

I've been an AVISPA user since October 2005 and I have a small request 
to ask of members of this mailing list. It is not related to AVISPA 
itself, but rather my own research in the field of security protocols 
analysis. I'm developing a framework of tools and techniques with a 
purpose of supporting users wanting to utilize formal methods for 
security protocols analysis. The goal of the framework is to bring 
formal methods closer to practitioners, i.e. software engineers and 
designers. My own experience so far has been mainly with the 
CSP/FDR/Casper approach and, not surprisingly, AVISPA.

Right now the framework is pretty much done, at least from the 
methodology standpoint (tool support is another story). Right now I'm 
preparing a usability study of the techniques I've prepared. I'd like to 
measure the usability characteristics of the framework such as 
relevance, usefulness, ease-of-use etc. using an approach derived from 
software quality management (I have a strong background in software 
engineering myself). For this purpose, I need an more-or-less 
independently derived set of requirements and evaluation criteria.

And that is where you come in. I have prepared a small web-based survey 
which will allow me to recognize the expectations of users of a 
framework such as mine. Because the AVISPA community consists of 
individuals knowledgeable in the area and experienced with the 
technology, I would very much like to ask you to complete my survey. It 
consists mainly of "closed" multiple-choice questions and should not 
take you more than 10 to 15 minutes.

The URL adrress for my survey is: http://kio.pg.gda.pl/iag/survey/

The survey form is processed by a free Reponse-o-Matic service. It's as 
anonymous as I could manage on a short notice: you don't have to provide 
or use your email address, no IPs are logged etc.

Again, your help would be greatly appreciated.

Best regards,

  Can someone tell me how can I find details of the executability problems if they occur.
  The command avispa code.hlpsl --ofmc -sessco returns " the code is not executable" without giving additional information. This problem take place even with TLS.hlpsl giving as example in the avispa package.
  Thanks a lot.

Hi Jeffrey,

you're right, the same problem has occurred again. Currently,
the machine that hosts the backends and the translator is down and
we're checking what's going on with it. A proper notice has
been put online on the AVISPA web pages.

We will inform you (and all the mailing list members) as soon
as we fix the problem.

Sorry, we apologize for this inconvenient.

Jacopo.

Dear AVISPA users,
the AVISPA web interface is again up-and-running!  All these troubles
have been due to
intensive memory swap in the machine running the AVISPA backends (i.e.
OFMC, SATMC,
CL-AtSe, and TA4SP).  To solve this issue we have imposed that a limited
number of AVISPA
backends can be run concurrently. When the message

"Sorry too many backends are running and there are not enough resources
available. Please try later.."

is returned to you means that this limit has been exceeded.  Moreover
each backend process
is limited to run up to 200 MB RAM.  As soon as the backend process
requires more than 200MB,
the process is killed by the Operating System. 

This is the best we can do at the moment.  Notice that the AVISPA web
interface is not meant
to be used for time and memory intensive experiments but just as a demo
for presenting the
tool.  For intensive test we recommend to download the AVISPA package. 

Best regards,
Luca

Dear David,
we apologize for all these troubles.  Unfortunately the machine on which
the
AVISPA web interface runs crashed over the week-end.  I have just rebooted
it, but given the last events this machine is not reliable.  We will have a

The software of the web-interface is not distributed. It will be soon.

FYI, the AVISPA web interface seems to be having trouble again.
It gives the following error:


AVISPA Web Tool
===============

The HLPSL2IF translator is reporting the following error:

Secure connection to 130.251.7.42 refused.



Is the software to run my own copy of the AVISPA web page interface
available in the AVISPA distribution?  I'm having my undergraduate class
use this in their class project, and I'd be happy to run a separate copy
of the web page on my own machine just for my class if that makes things
any easier.

Thanks.

No problem.  I'm sorry to cause you trouble.

Wonderful!  Thank you very much!  This is a great resource, and I
very much appreciate your help in enabling my students to learn to
use the AVISPA tools.

Thanks again,

Subject: [Avispa-users] Hello and Introduction
Message-ID: <6216396AEBE36247BF62B505A88ADA0A0C222E83@uk-ex002.groupinfra.com>

Hello,

 

How are you?  I am taking the (part time) MSc in Information Security at
Royal Holloway University of London.  I would appreciate any comments or
suggestions that you have regarding my initial ideas as described below.

 

I would like to do my MSc project (to be completed by 8 September 2006)
on mathematical analysis of security protocols.  The BAN logic (Mike
Burrows, Martin Abadi, and Roger Needham) may provide a good starting
point since it was the first and is probably the most famous analytical
method.  However, there are other formal methodologies.  Some suitable
websites that I have found as a result of an initial search are as
follows (although I have not investigated them very deeply at present):

 

*         http://www.avispa-project.org/ (of course)

*         http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/lcp/papers/protocols.html

*         http://www.stcatz.ox.ac.uk/academic_staff_pages/lowe_gavin.htm

*
http://portal.surrey.ac.uk/portal/page?_pageid=798,332537&_dad=portal&_s
chema=PORTAL

*         And many others!!!

 

It would be interesting to see if the newer methods can find known (and
possibly additional) vulnerabilities that have already been found by
utilisation of the traditional methods, but perhaps shorter, faster or
more elegantly.  It may also be interesting to see whether security
protocols that have not yet been formally analysed could be subjected to
modern mathematical analyses.  To find a significant vulnerability in a
relatively new protocol would be an excellent bonus for this MSc
project, although the time constraints may preclude this eventuality.

 

In addition to the MSc in Information Security which is in progress at
present, my formal academic & professional qualifications are as
follows:

 

*         BSc, Grade II(i), Pure Mathematics, University of Kent, 1984.

*         MPhil (by thesis), Mathematical Logic, University of
Nottingham, 1987.

*         BCS ISEB Certificate in Information Security Management
Principles, 2000.

*         Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP),
2004.

*         (plus many other smaller/specialised security courses and
training.)

 

A brief overview of my career and experience is as follows.  In the
Systems Assurance Division of EDS in the early 1990s I was in a team
that developed a Z tool in Lisp on Sun workstations, for CESG.  Then I
moved into projects performing safety critical static source code
analysis using SPADE and MALPAS.  We also developed a proprietary static
code analysis tool written initially in Prolog and then completely
rewritten in SML.  After that I joined the CLEF part of EDS to do an
ITSEC E3 evaluation of a database.  In 1996 I joined the Logica CLEF to
do further ITSEC and Common Criteria evaluations covering operating
systems, databases, firewalls, crypto tools, etc.  From 2000 to 2002 I
worked for Platform 7 Limited (which was bought by Datacard) on smart
card security.  I am currently in the LogicaCMG CLEF at Leatherhead,
doing Common Criteria security evaluations and consultancy.

 

Thanks in advance for your general comments on the above.

 

I look forward to your reply.

 

Bhavin.

http://csysec.univ-pau.fr/sarssi/
==========================================================================

After the success of the four former SAR conferences, SAR 2006 will take
place in Seignosse, France. SAR 2006 covers a large spectrum of research
on security and network architectures. The purpose of the conference is
to offer to the computer science community - engineers, researchers,
teachers and students - the opportunity to discuss advances in research
and development in network security.

The conference will enable scientists to present the last advances in
the network security domain and to analyze the impact of these emerging
technologies on this domain. Part of the conference is devoted to
tutorials in advanced fields of security in order to encourage
interactions and exchanges between participants.

Papers offering novel research contributions in any aspect of computer
security or electronic privacy are solicited for submission to the 2006
symposium. Papers may represent advances in the theory, design,
implementation, analysis, or empirical evaluation of secure systems,
either for general use or for specific application domains.

This Year: SAR 2006 is open to submissions not only of full-length
papers but also short papers (extended abstracts) describing less mature
work. Submissions can be either in French or English, see the web site
for details.
