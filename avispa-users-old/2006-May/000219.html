<PRE>Hi Ilham and David,

I have a slightly different view on this. Since this was an issue
often discussed, let me give a brief summary.

Please keep in mind that our models are abstracting away a lot of
details of cryptography. From such an abstract viewpoint there is not
much difference between the least significant bits of a timestamp and
a nonce -- in particular they are both unpredicatable. (Though the
upper bits of the timestamp are not, and they may allow dictionary
attacks.) In fact, what timestamps should achieve is to limit the time
window in which a message is accepted by a recipient and thus limiting
the replay of messages. So what we did in AVISPA was to use *weak*
authentication instead of the standard authentication as a goal: all
those attacks are ignored, in which some participant merely accepts
something several times, since such attacks are easily prevented by
the timestamp mechanism. So we don't have to think about complicated
models with precise notions of time, intervals, expiration times ...

Note, however, that in such a setting even minor authentication
problems (that seem negligible) may have consequences on the timestamp
mechanism of the &quot;real&quot; protocol: e.g. in Wide-Mouth-Frog protocol, a
small authentication problem leads to the possibility that the
intruder keeps a session &quot;alive&quot; forever (and this consequence we
cannot see in our model). 

Regards,
Sebastian

 &gt; Hi all,
 &gt; 
 &gt; I have seen several protocol models in AVISPA library that use
 &gt; timestamp, such as Kerberos and APOP. In those models, timestamp is
 &gt; always assigned with new(). The user manual states new() as creating a
 &gt; nonce. However, the timestamp concept is not just about giving it some
 &gt; random value. At the very least, the random value should be a sequence
 &gt; number. 
 &gt; 
 &gt; Could anyone be so kind to explain/refer to an article the justification
 &gt; of the assignment of new() to timestamp in protocol modelling in HLPSL?
 &gt; 
 &gt; Sincerely yours,
 &gt; 
 &gt; Ilham
