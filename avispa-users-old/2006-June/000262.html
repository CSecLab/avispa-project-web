<PRE>Hello,

I am using the CL-AtSe backend for my MSc project (I require the 
in-built xor handling functions) and have a few questions:

1.
I notice that CL-AtSe does not process a prelude file, but instead uses 
a hardcoded one. However, I wanted to disable the intruder's ability to 
generate new instances of specific types e.g. VAR_A(12). Is there 
another way in which this can be done?

The reason I ask is that there are a number of trivial attacks found in 
my models when the intruder is able to generate known symmetric keys.


2.
I have two variants of a particular model, one where all the 
(non-deterministic) transitions are included in a single role, and one 
where each transition is modelled as a separate role. From the output 
of the -noexec option, it appears that CL-AtSe builds the entire tree 
of possible transition interleavings for each role. This causes a huge 
discrepancy in the time it takes to process each model. In the first 
case, the conversion from IF seems exponential in the number of 
transitions (due to the tree being built), whereas the latter case 
seems to be linear in the number of roles.

I am interested to know why CL-AtSe is able to handle non-determinism 
between roles (i.e. from the composition of roles) almost trivially, 
but has serious trouble with non-determinism within a role?

As mentioned, I have worked around the issue for now, but the model is 
less intuitive.


3.
In the attack traces produced, only communications are included. Any 
manipulation of data by the intruder is not. This can sometimes make it 
quite hard to work out exactly what the intruder has done.

It would be nice if it was possible to see what the intruder was doing 
in an attack trace.


4.
When the -notypes option is not used, the intruder's ability to xor 
known items together seems to be lost. Also, because the 'light' 
unification algorithm is used, {X}_Y does not unify with {xor(A,B)}_Y. 
Is this intentional?

It would be good if it was possible to use the full unification 
algorithm even when -notypes is not used. Is the intruder's ability to 
xor known data dependant on the unification algorithm?

Again, this is not really a problem for me since using -notypes gets 
round it, but it may be for other people.



thanks in advance,

Gavin Keighren
