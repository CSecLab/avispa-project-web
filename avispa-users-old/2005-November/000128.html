<PRE>Hi!

 &gt; I am trying to write the model of SPLICE/AS protocol. In expert
 &gt; mode, when I execute the OFMConly I have received the following
 &gt; attack:

 [...]

 &gt; Now, I have some questions:
 &gt; 
 &gt; 1. Is this possible to get multiple attack traces (if they exist)
 &gt; for one specification?

This is not possible as the tools stop the search at the first attack
they find, and continuing the search might just result in lots of
variants of basically the same attack. I recommend that you drop the
goal that was found violated (e.g. authentication in one direction),
to see if the other goals of the protocol do hold.

 &gt; 2. What is the meaning of 3 in (c,3)? Does it mean the 3rd session
 &gt; or anything else? And why this number is dicrete like 3, 13,17..?

Yes they are session numbers, their choice has technical reasons. 

 &gt; 3. What is the meaning of 1 in N1(1)?  
 &gt; 
 &gt; 4. In this attack trace, the last two messages are quite
 &gt; redundant. Otherwise, this is a successfull attack. Anybody any
 &gt; clue about it?

These are also minor technical issues, sorry. (For question 3., the
reason is to create unique terms for fresh nonces, and for question
4., the redundancy has to do with the attack predicates.)

 &gt; 5. Where can I get more information about the ourput of OFMC, ATSE
 &gt; and other tools?

The manuals/guides that you can download as part of the avispa tool
should contain all the information that is necessary to work with the
tools, however if there are questions that are not addressed, the user
forum is the right place to ask them. 

 &gt; Thank you for your understanding. I am really interested in using
 &gt; AVISPA and I have found this one of the best tools for security
 &gt; protocols.

Thanks for your interest!

Cheers,
Sebastian
