Subject: [Avispa-users] General questions about the output
Message-ID: <BAY104-DAV724B5B51CDD8ECA52BDC4CF6F0@phx.gbl>

Hi,

I am trying to write the model of SPLICE/AS protocol. In expert mode, when I execute the OFMConly I have received the following attack:

ATTACK TRACE
i -> (c,3): start
(c,3) -> i: c.s.N1(1)
i -> (a,13): c.i.N1(1)
(a,13) -> i: a.{a.c.N1(1).ki}_inv(ka)
i -> (c,3): a.{a.c.N1(1).ki}_inv(ka)
(c,3) -> i: c.s.{c.T(3).lt.{N2(3)}_ki}_inv(kc)
i -> (a,13): i.c.x66
(a,13) -> i: a.{a.i.x66.kc}_inv(ka)
i -> (i,17): N2(3)
i -> (i,17): N2(3)

Now, I have some questions:

1. Is this possible to get multiple attack traces (if they exist) for one specification? 

2. What is the meaning of 3 in (c,3)? Does it mean the 3rd session or anything else? And why this number is dicrete like 3, 13,17..?

3. What is the meaning of 1 in N1(1)?  

4. In this attack trace, the last two messages are quite redundant. Otherwise, this is a successfull attack. Anybody any clue about it?

5. Where can I get more information about the ourput of OFMC, ATSE and other tools?

Thank you for your understanding. I am really interested in using AVISPA and I have found this one of the best tools for security protocols. 

Regards,

Salekul

This is not possible as the tools stop the search at the first attack
they find, and continuing the search might just result in lots of
variants of basically the same attack. I recommend that you drop the
goal that was found violated (e.g. authentication in one direction),
to see if the other goals of the protocol do hold.

Yes they are session numbers, their choice has technical reasons.

These are also minor technical issues, sorry. (For question 3., the
reason is to create unique terms for fresh nonces, and for question
4., the redundancy has to do with the attack predicates.)

The manuals/guides that you can download as part of the avispa tool
should contain all the information that is necessary to work with the
tools, however if there are questions that are not addressed, the user
forum is the right place to ask them.

Thanks for your interest!

Hi Oliver,

David has referred me to you regarding a verification of the onion
routing protocol.  Have you done something similar to this?  If so what
were your findings?  I am looking to verify a protocol named Tor (a
second generation onion routing protocol) using the AVISPA framework.  I
appreciate any help you may be able to provide.

Thanks,
Meron

Back in July we discussed several improvements to the avispa tools, and
Jacopo mentioned that a new release was scheduled for later this
year.

Is that going to happen anytime soon?

I have just started work on a project on which I want to use avispa, and
would love to use an improved version if one is about to become
available.

Dear Salekul,

The OFMC -sessco option searches for replay attacks and checks whether 
all states are reachable. Given what you have said I assume you are 
using OFMC to see if the model is executable? The error message would 
suggest that some transitions in your protocol cannot be reached.

You may be interested in the following code if you want to search for 
replay attacks (without the sessco option):

role environment()
def=

    ...

    composition
       session(a,b)
    /\ session(a,b)

end role

With regards my previous response I was not trying to sound patronising 
by suggesting you read the manual. It is a necessity, if you wish to be 
able to understand the tool. With reference to the notation (a,5) the 
letter refers to a role (eg. alice) and the number is a session number 
(in this case 5). The session number is used internally by AVISPA and 
you can simply ignore it.


Regards,

Ben

It may be worth including the documentation included in the download

Dear Wilfred,

You can find several not yet specified protocols in the file named
Deliverable 6.1, accessible from the AVISPA library web page:
		http://www.avispa-project.org/library/

If you can specify and study some of them (or some others), we would
be very happy to add them in the AVISPA library.

Best regards,
Laurent.

You may want to have a look at SPORE (Security Protocol Open Repository)
http://www.lsv.ens-cachan.fr/spore/

There you may find some protocols that are not yet included in the library.

Hi All,

I am a new user to Avispa tool. I was trying to execute a HLPSL code of 
a network protocol.

The first output for the code was:
AVISPA Tool Summary
OFMC: UNSAFE    CL-AtSe: UNSAFE    SATMC: SAFE      TA4SP: INCONCLUSIVE

After some modifications of the protocol, such as managing the witness 
and request commands well, I got the following o/p:
AVISPA Tool Summary
OFMC: SAFE    CL-AtSe: Error     SATMC: SAFE     TA4SP: Error

If anyone has come across similar kind of execution problem, please 
share your experience with me.

thanks in advance,
Anil

Anil,

It would appear that you are using the web interface 
(http://www.avispa-project.org/web-interface/) it is possible to 
download and run AVISPA locally. I would recommend this if you plan to 
use the tool seriously.

As for the messages you are receiving
OFMC    : SAFE
CL-AtSe : SAFE
SATMC   : SAFE
TA4SP   : SAFE

OFMC, CL-AtSe, SATMC and TA4SP simply refer to the backend in use. The 
online tool will attempt to execute your protocol with each backend in turn.

If you download the tool it will come complete with documentation, which 
provides a good starting point for understaning the tool and will 
include further explanation.


Regards,

Ben

Dear Ben,

following your suggestion, we've put the documentation
of the avispa tool online, in pdf format.
It now lives at

http://www.avispa-project.org/publications.html

Thank you, and sorry for the delayed reply!

Best regards,

Jacopo.

Hi guys,
I attempted to use the web-based interface serveral times but the 
web-based interface is no longer working. I mean if you run any 
protocol, its giving the foll message:

AVISPA Web Tool
===============
The HLPSL2IF translator is reporting the following error:
Secure connection to 130.251.7.42 refused

Any one has got a clue for this problem,

Anil

Dear Anil,
you are right. During the night the machine used to run the AVISPA modules
(back-ends and translator) crashed.  We are re-started the machine and now
it seems to work again. 

We will try to investigate what happened to the machine and in any case we
will monitor its behaviour.  Please continue inform us if something weird
happens.

Thanks a lot for the collaboration!

Dear Anil,
as Ben was saying it is definetely better to use the AVISPA package for
making tests. 
The web interface should just be thought as a mode to get the feeling of
the AVISPA
tool.  For instance,  the resources (memory and time) assigned to each
test are
significantly limited on the web interface machine so to avoid memory
swap and similar.

A part from this, I would be interesting in knowing whether you have
understood why the
backends return different answers.  If you have not, maybe you could
share your HLPSL
specification with us so that we can work together to understand the
reasons.

Best regards,
Luca

Hi Guys,
I was trying to execute my HLPSL code on Linux machine.

When I give the command:  ./avispa filename.hlpsl --ofmc

At first, the HLPSL code was throwing attacks. But when I have just 
modified the intruder knowledge parameters (I removed a few 
parameters), the program was not responding (and after that the program 
crashes). I always get the following message:

% OFMC
% Version of 2005/06/07
SUMMARY


Can anyone tell whats going on the backend of my machine. To tell you, 
I have like 60MB of free space on my hard-disk. Is this because of that 
or is it anything else going on.


Anil

Subject: [Avispa-users] An invitation to contribute to my research
Message-ID: <4384A233.3000203@eti.pg.gda.pl>

Hi,

I've been an AVISPA user since October 2005 and I have a small request 
to ask of members of this mailing list. It is not related to AVISPA 
itself, but rather my own research in the field of security protocols 
analysis. I'm developing a framework of tools and techniques with a 
purpose of supporting users wanting to utilize formal methods for 
security protocols analysis. The goal of the framework is to bring 
formal methods closer to practitioners, i.e. software engineers and 
designers. My own experience so far has been mainly with the 
CSP/FDR/Casper approach and, not surprisingly, AVISPA.

Right now the framework is pretty much done, at least from the 
methodology standpoint (tool support is another story). Right now I'm 
preparing a usability study of the techniques I've prepared. I'd like to 
measure the usability characteristics of the framework such as 
relevance, usefulness, ease-of-use etc. using an approach derived from 
software quality management (I have a strong background in software 
engineering myself). For this purpose, I need an more-or-less 
independently derived set of requirements and evaluation criteria.

And that is where you come in. I have prepared a small web-based survey 
which will allow me to recognize the expectations of users of a 
framework such as mine. Because the AVISPA community consists of 
individuals knowledgeable in the area and experienced with the 
technology, I would very much like to ask you to complete my survey. It 
consists mainly of "closed" multiple-choice questions and should not 
take you more than 10 to 15 minutes.

The URL adrress for my survey is: http://kio.pg.gda.pl/iag/survey/

The survey form is processed by a free Reponse-o-Matic service. It's as 
anonymous as I could manage on a short notice: you don't have to provide 
or use your email address, no IPs are logged etc.

Again, your help would be greatly appreciated.

Best regards,

Hi;
  Can someone tell me how can I find details of the executability problems if they occur.
  The command avispa code.hlpsl --ofmc -sessco returns " the code is not executable" without giving additional information. This problem take place even with TLS.hlpsl giving as example in the avispa package.
  Thanks a lot.

Hello.  I am experiencing the same issue with the web-interface as

"During the night the machine used to run the AVISPA modules (back-ends

"We will try to investigate what happened to the machine and in any case

I think this has occured again.  Can somebody please check into this?

Hi Jeffrey,

you're right, the same problem has occurred again. Currently,
the machine that hosts the backends and the translator is down and
we're checking what's going on with it. A proper notice has
been put online on the AVISPA web pages.

We will inform you (and all the mailing list members) as soon
as we fix the problem.

Sorry, we apologize for this inconvenient.

Best Regards,

Jacopo.
