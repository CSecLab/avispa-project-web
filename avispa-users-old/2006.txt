Dear Desai,

sorry for taking so long to reply.  You may find a concise description
of the AVISPA Tool as well as a brief summary of experimental results
showing the level of automation that our tool is capable of at the
following URL:

http://www.avispa-project.org/papers/avispa-cav05.ps

This paper, together with the information available at the AVISPA web
page, provides a good starting point.  Should you need further
information please do not hesitate to contact us.  We will be more
reactive next time.  I promise! :-)

Best Regards,

Subject: [Avispa-users] Workshop on Collaboration and Security
Message-ID: <43D65AA3.7000704@loria>

                                 CALL FOR PAPERS

                      Workshop on Collaboration and Security
                                   (COLSEC'06)

                       The 2006 International Symposium on
                 Collaborative Technologies and Systems (CTS'06)
                                 May 14-17, 2006
                              Las Vegas, Nevada, USA
                http://www.engr.udayton.edu/faculty/wsmari/cts06/


   -------------------------------------------------------------------------
                      Submission Deadline: February 7, 2006
   -------------------------------------------------------------------------


Brief Description:

Collaboration relies on distributed systems that provide the required
security properties.  Virtual organizations often use the Internet to
support collaboration.  The Internet, operating systems and distributed
environments currently suffer from poor security support and cannot resist
common attacks (spamming, worms, session hijacking, buffer overflow, denial
of service, social engineering, etc.).  Collaborative organizations require
better security properties (strong authentication, efficient encryption,
Mandatory Access Control, insurance of confidentiality, integrity,
non-repudiation and availability).  Nowadays, collaborative organizations
use new technologies such as mobile devices, smartcards, wireless networks,
high performance networks and grid computing.  These environments introduce
new needs, requirements and difficulties related to security.  Hence,
collaborative organizations and technologies face several challenges in the
field of security.

This Workshop on Security and Collaboration - to be held as part of the 2006
International Symposium on Collaborative Technologies and Systems (CTS'06) -
will focus on security issues related to collaborative systems with emphasis
on distributed environments, smartcards, grid or clustering systems for
cooperation, mobile and wireless cooperation.  The aim is to have a
dedicated workshop that fosters closer interactions among researchers and
users communities, providing an excellent opportunity for them to meet and
discuss their ideas.  It addresses specifically relationships between
collaborative systems and security.  It intends to present new challenges
and solutions related to latest security requirements, specific methods of
access control enabling large scale cooperation, usage of mobile
technologies and smartcards, new security infrastructures supporting better
prevention, detection, recovery and healing in the context of cooperative
systems.  It will also consider security in different domains of application
(e.g., e-Government, e-Business, Public Services, P2P, e-Social Security,
Medical Collaboration, ...).

We invite original contributions from researchers in academia, research
institutions and industry on these emerging and important areas of
information technology.

Workshop topics include, but are not limited to, the following:
* Frameworks for Security in Collaborative Systems
* Access Control in Collaborative Environments
* Trusted Operating Systems for Distributed Environments
* Security of Grid and Cluster Architectures Supporting Cooperative
      Applications
* Honeypots for Collaborative Systems
*  Intrusion and Attacks Detection for Collaborative Systems
* Role Based, Reputation, and Trust
* Encryption and Cryptography Systems Supporting Cooperative Systems
* Use of Smartcards in the Context of Collaboration
* Security in Mobile and Wireless Networks
* Disclosure and Integrity Issues
* Resistance to Denial of Service
* Detection and Self-Recovery Schemes and Strategies Supporting Cooperation
* Security for Specific Collaboration Domains (e.g., e-Government,
      e-Business, Public Services, P2P, e-Social Security, Medical
      Collaboration)

Submission Instructions:

The exp operator should work fine but only for those tools that support
it. SATMC is not one of them. OFMC and CL-atse
should support this operator. In case you have any other question do not
hesitate to contact us.

Dear AVISPA users and developers,

A new version of OFMC has just been released. The most important new
feature is that the user can specify a custom algebraic theory modulo
which the entire protocol analysis is performed. 

You can download the new version from

Hello,

What sorts of sessions you want depends on the protocol and what  
sorts of attacks you think the protocol might be vulnerable to.  And  
also what sorts of assumptions you have on your protocol.

For instance, in the example you list, the session P,I has the  
intruder playing the role of the server.  Many protocols assume that  
the server is trusted and not compromised, so if we are working with  
this assumption then there is no need to analyze a session where the  
intruder plays the role of the server.  (If you do, you may of course  
find attacks, but they may be trivial.)

So if you have an authentication protocol between A and B which you  
want to analyze for vulnerability to Man-in-the-middle attacks,  
sessions between (A,B) (A,I) and (I,B) are good bets.  Two identical  
sessions between (A,B) and (A,B) are useful to look for replay-style  
attacks.

I realize this is a bit of a heuristic, but it can be useful to  
experiment with different analysis scenarios in order to give  
yourself greater confidence in your protocol.

I hope this helps,
Paul.

 Verification of Embedded Systems
Message-ID: <4418368F.3090706@lsv.ens-cachan.fr>

*** Apologies for multiple copies ***

Dear colleague,

We wish to invite you to participate to the ARTIST-2 informal workshop
on security of embedded systems. ARTIST-2 is a European Network of
Excellence on Embedded Systems Design (http://www.artist-embedded.org/FP6/).

The workshop will focus on the formal specification and verification
of security properties, and in particular on the specification and
formal verification of security protocols. Topics include, but are not
limited to:

    * formal definition and verification of security properties
    * formal analysis and design of cryptographic protocols
    * modeling information flow
    * formal techniques for (mobile) code security;
    * security in real-time/probabilistic systems;
    * language-based security;
    * theory and application of policy languages and trust management

One of the goals of the workshop is to bring together the part of the
Artist2 community working on security, nevertheless, the workshop is
open to anyone.

The program of the workshop will include invited talks, regular talks
and plenty of time for discussion. We expect to include both short
(~10-20 minutes) and long (~40-50 minutes) talks.

The workshop will take place at Pisa, Tuscany, Italy on May 18th and
will be co-located with iTrust2006 (http://www.iit.cnr.it/iTrust2006/).

If you are interested in giving a talk, please send an email before
April 7 to

    artist2-sw@iit.cnr.it

indicating a title, a short abstract (one or two paragraphs) and
whether you intend to give a long or a short talk.

The participation to the workshop is free but registration is
mandatory. Updated information will be accessible at the workshop
website:

Hi List --

1. Could someone point to more AVISPA examples on password-based
protocols (in addition to SRP, EKE, SPEKE available in the current
distribution)?

2. What are the differences between a parameter declared in a "role"
and inside a role as a "local" variable?

Thanks for your time.

Hi Mohammad,

This is exactly the same difference as between a parameter and a local
variable in the declaration of a function: a parameter is an
information comming from the outside; it is instantiated when the role
is called; a local variable belongs only to the role where it is
defined, and it may not have an initial value.

Subject: [Avispa-users] about 'secrecy' statement and Kerberos
Message-ID: <20060330084406.GA10101@mlserv.jaist.ac.jp>

Hi, 

In the user-manual (p.26 guidelines about secrecy goal specification)
, it is said that "If a value T that should be kept secret is
determined by a single role (in particular, if it is an atomic value
like a nonce produced by new()), then the secrecy statement should
be given in -- and only in -- the role introducing the value".

In case of Kerberos, the TGS session key (the key that will be
shared between a client and the TGS) is generated by the AS,
hence the secrecy statement related to TGS sessoin should be present
only on the AS role.

However, in the example "Kerbers-basic" provided in the "The AVISPA
Library of protocols" the secrecy statement of TGS session key is
present in the AS, TGS and the client.


So, I guess that one of the following is true :

- I did not understood what is said in the HLPSL guidelines
- There is a mistake in the HLPSL specification of Kerberos-basic


I would appreciate any clarifications,


Regards,
Saber.

Bonjour,

My french is no good, so I will try to write in basic English.

You need to use the best tool (program) for the job (task). I could not 
find anything about CASPER or EVA, do you have the web address?

Here is my argument for using ProVerif in favour of AVISPA and CAPSL. My 
goals are: prove that a state is unreachable (secrecy) and demonstrate 
privacy using observational equivalence. I need to be able to define 
equations. (this is taken straight from my dissertation, so probably 
isn't basic english. Its in LaTeX format)

CAPSL is unsuitable since it can only model authentication and 
key-exchange. Similarly AVISPA supports only authentication and secrecy. 
Although in theory it is possible to define one's own rules using 
AVISPA's Intermediate Format (IF) language~\cite{AVISPA03} - which would 
permit the modeling of further requirements - in reality such usage is 
unsupported\footnotemark. ProVerif permits the verification of privacy 
using observational equivalence. However, its ability is not complete 
and thus it is commonly necessary to complete a proof by hand. Although 
not perfect ProVerif is the only tool which meets the demands of the 
analysis.

\footnotetext{Sebastian M\"{o}dersheim has since made claims that 
AVISPA's \emph{On-the-Fly Model-Checker} (OFMC) back-end is now capable 
(February, 2006) of handling user defined algebraic expressions. At the 
time of analysis support was classified as beta and it was therefore 
decided to utilise a tool which is known to provide the necessary 
functionality.}


au revior,

Ben

  *i is very helpful if each authors (of specification ) add comments in  his specification to help undestanding. in fact there is some ambiguit?  in protocole like EAP protocole.
  
  *if possible authors let there contact (email) to can contact them and discuss about their idea of sp?cification

I'm not the author of the Kerberos specs, but did some updates
on them last year. I think that the extra secrecy statements in
Kerb-* are still there for historical reasons and should be removed.

Subject: [Avispa-users] HLSPL protocol Animator and Graphical Interface for
	AVISPA
Message-ID: <44324478.5010403@irisa.fr>

Hi to all avispa users,


Here in IRISA, we are currently developping an animation tool to ease 
the design of HLPSL specifications. From an HLPSL specification, it is 
possible to interactively produce a Message Sequence Chart (MSC) 
corresponding to an execution of the specification. Here are some features:

1) When the protocol is non-deterministic or several sessions are runned 
in parallel, choices are proposed to the user in order to select a 
particular execution.

2) It is possible to go back in the execution

3) Save, run again MSCs

4) Hide/show content of variables of roles


The tool also contains a graphical interface equivalent to the web 
interface of AVISPA but which permits a local use. The tool is currently 
under development but is already usable. When the development will be 
completed, the tool will be distributed under an open source licence.

For the moment, if someone is interested in early testing of a binary 
version (linux and Tk) of this tool, please  mail me 
(thomas.genet@irisa.fr) or the main developper (yann.glouche@irisa.fr).


Yann and I hope this will help in the tuning of HLPSL specification,

Best regards,


Thomas

Hi Omar,

They verify authentication.  One pair of witness/request serves for  
unilateral authentication, if you want mutual then you need to define  
two pairs.  I wrote an email with an analogy of witness/request facts  
answering a similar question a while back.  Maybe it will be of some  
help.

----------------------------------------
witness and request events are kinda complicated, but they work and they
are actually reasonably powerful.  Here's the deal: let's say you and me
are sitting in our houses down the street from each other executing
NSPK.  You're Alice and I'm Bob.  You create for me some random nonce
called Na and send it to me in a letter.  When you do this, you raise a
little red flag that indicates what the random value for Na was, let's
say 17.  So at your house you fly a red flag that says "Marie's value
for Paul, which is called Na, is 17."  In AVISPA, we call these flags
witness facts.  So in NSPK, the fact
    witness(A,B,bob_alice_na,Na')
that Alice emits in the example on the web means "My name is A, and I
created the value Na' for the guy named B.  I created it for the purpose
called bob_alice_na."  The purpose is just a name and could be anything,
but it ensures that the intruder can't do any funny stuff like take a
value that you intended as your nonce Na, and inject it someplace else
where I want you to send me, for example, your public key.

Ok, so that's you.  Now over at my place I'm Bob.  I get a letter from
you.  It's got what is supposedly your nonce in it and your name,
encrypted for me.  Then at the end of the protocol, you have sent me
back my Nb and that's supposed to prove to me that it's really you,
right?  So what I do after I get that last message is I fly a little
blue flag at my house that indicates what I believe your value for Na
was.  So my flag says "I'm Paul, and the value for Na that I believe I
got from Marie, is 17."  This, in AVISPA, is done with a request flag.
In NSPK, in the Bob role we have
    request(B,A,bob_alice_na,Na)
and this says "I'm B, I believe I'm talking to A and she sent me the
value Na for the purpose bob_alice_na."

So far so good?  I hope so.

So where's the intruder?  The intruder is the mailman.  He's carrying
the letters between our two houses, and he can open 'em, read 'em, and
replace them with his own letters if he wants.  The only thing he can't
do is decrypt stuff when he doesn't have the key.  ALSO, he can't climb
on top of our houses and replace the flags.  So when you fly your red
flag and I fly my blue one, he can't screw around with those or take
them down.

Almost finished I promise.  So where's the AVISPA Tool?  The AVISPA Tool
is a guy across the street with binoculars.  His job is to look our for
flags and make sure they match in a particular way.  What way?  Well,
for authentication what he looks for is this: if he EVER sees a blue
flag go up (Bob's flag), then there MUST be a red flag someplace with
the same people, the same purpose, and the same value.  So if my flag
says I believe the value 17 came from you, your flag must say you
created the value 17 for me for the same purpose.  And if you have
replay protection (i.e. request and not wrequest), then those flags
better be unique.  If I fly two blue flags that look the same, there
better be two red flags on your house.  Otherwise it means the intruder,
the mailman, photocopied your letters and is delivering them to me again
(maybe even after you moved away!).

That's how witness and request events work.  The AVISPA Tool looks for
situations in which they see the first request flag above, and make sure
that when it comes there is a matching witness that looks like the one
above.  If not, it's an attack.

Who decides the goals?  That's one of the challenges of modelling
protocols.  Generally, we try to extract them from the description of
the protocol that's in an RFC or something.  They are sometimes
intuitively clear: if two people exchange a key for instance, it's
reasonable to assume that good goals include that the key should be
secret and they should agree upon its value, so it should be  
authenticated.
----------------------------------------

Cheers,
Paul.

Great!  The tool your are developing is very interesting and has many
interesting features that are currently missing in the AVISPA Tool.  So
the your activity is very welcomed!

I'd be interested.  Could you please send me a copy (or instruction on
how to get it)?

Dear Ben

  - HLPSL/IF have a large expressiveness, basically we can formulate all
kinds of distributed systems and also custom goals

  - There are quite different back-ends connected to AVISPA, allowing us
to perform verification both for a small number of sessions of
complicated protocols and goals, and (like ProVerif) an unbounded
number of sessions for simple protocols and secrecy.

  - Cl-AtSe and OFMC avispa back ends can handle algebraic properties, 
as Cl-AtSe has efficient implementations for the most popular 
properties, and OFMC allows the user to even specify his custom 
algebraic theory. This helps when modelling new cryptographic primitives 
or abstracting away details of the protocol.

  - also i dont understand the connection you made in your mail
  between the limitations on  properties like
  authentication and secrecy and the algebraic expressions;
  note also that since ProveriF is based on applied pi
  calculus it may need  more equational presentations
  (e.g. for standard encryption/decryption) where for avispa it is 
built-in; i am not completely sure about that but it might be the source 
of the confusion.

- maybe it would be useful for all  if you show  samples of  the 
equational properties you need to model , so that we can compare the 
different techniques

  best regards

  michael

Bonjour,

My french is no good, so I will try to write in basic English.

You need to use the best tool (program) for the job (task). I could not
find anything about CASPER or EVA, do you have the web address?

Here is my argument for using ProVerif in favour of AVISPA and CAPSL. My
goals are: prove that a state is unreachable (secrecy) and demonstrate
privacy using observational equivalence. I need to be able to define
equations. (this is taken straight from my dissertation, so probably
isn't basic english. Its in LaTeX format)

CAPSL is unsuitable since it can only model authentication and
key-exchange. Similarly AVISPA supports only authentication and secrecy.
Although in theory it is possible to define one's own rules using
AVISPA's Intermediate Format (IF) language~\cite{AVISPA03} - which would
permit the modeling of further requirements - in reality such usage is
unsupported\footnotemark. ProVerif permits the verification of privacy
using observational equivalence. However, its ability is not complete
and thus it is commonly necessary to complete a proof by hand. Although
not perfect ProVerif is the only tool which meets the demands of the
analysis.

\footnotetext{Sebastian M\"{o}dersheim has since made claims that
AVISPA's \emph{On-the-Fly Model-Checker} (OFMC) back-end is now capable
(February, 2006) of handling user defined algebraic expressions. At the
time of analysis support was classified as beta and it was therefore
decided to utilise a tool which is known to provide the necessary
functionality.}


au revior,

Ben

Dear Michael,

I would be more than happy to share my views. Feel free to ask any 
questions.

I first used AVISPA during September 2005 at which point I believe it 
was unable to model any algebraic properties. I can't recall the precise 
construct I was modeling at the time - but it was related to the CRS'05 
electronic voting protocol. Claims have since been made (February, 2006) 
via this mailing list that user defined equations are compatible with 
OFMC. At present I haven't had the time to confirm this claim for 
myself. I will do so at some point in the future.

Having re-read my previous comments, I can see how I've caused 
confusion! They were written in note form (which are pretty difficult to 
read for anyone else). My key point are:

* AVISPA cannot model observational equivalence - to the best of my 
knowledge.

* AVISPA was previously (before Feb 2006) unable to model user defined 
equations.

For this reason I chose ProVerif as opposed to AVISPA. The inability to 
define ones own equation was the biggest flaw and has (apparently - I 
need to confirm for myself) now been incorporated into OFMC.


To give a taste for the equations I have been modelling here's a basic 
example:

R_0^r_f_0 R_1^r_f_1 S^r_v' = U^-c R_0^s_f_0 R_1^s_f_1 S^s_v'

Where U = R_0^f_0 R_1^f_1 S^v', s_f_0 = r_f_0 + c*f_0, s_f_1 = r_f_1 + 
c*f_1 and s_v' = r_v' + c*v'

To witness this fact we must realise:

R_0^r_f_0 R_1^r_f_1 S^r_v' = R_0^(-c*f_0) R_1^(-c*f_1) S^(-c*v') 
R_0^s_f_0 R_1^s_f_1 S^s_v'

As I have said, it may now be possible to model this in AVISPA.



Regards,

Ben

BACKGROUND, AIM AND SCOPE
=========================

Computer security is an established field of computer science of both
theoretical and practical significance. In recent years, there has been
increasing interest in logic-based foundations for various methods in
computer security, including the formal specification, analysis and
design of security protocols and their applications, the formal
definition of various aspects of security such as access control
mechanisms, mobile code security and denial-of-service attacks, and the
modeling of information flow and its application to confidentiality
policies, system composition, and covert channel analysis.

The workshop FCS-ARSPA'06 is the fusion of two workshops. The workshop
FCS continues a tradition, initiated with the Workshops on Formal
Methods and Security Protocols (FMSP) in 1998 and 1999, then with the
Workshop on Formal Methods and Computer Security (FMCS) in 2000, and
finally with the LICS satellite Workshop on Foundations of Computer
Security (FCS) in 2002 through 2005, of bringing together formal methods
and the security community.

The ARSPA workshop is the third in a series of workshops on Automated
Reasoning for Security Protocol Analysis, bringing together researchers
and practitioners from both the security and the formal methods
communities, from academia and industry, who are working on developing
and applying automated reasoning techniques and tools for the formal
specification and analysis of security protocols. The first two ARSPA
workshops were held as satellite events of IJCAR'04 and of ICALP'05,
respectively.

The aim of the joint workshop FCS-ARSPA'06 is to provide a forum for
continued activity in these areas, to bring computer security
researchers in closer contact with the LICS community, and to give LICS
attendees an opportunity to talk to experts in computer security. We
thus solicit submissions of papers both on mature work and on work in
progress.

We are interested both in new results in theories of computer security
and also in more exploratory presentations that examine open questions
and raise fundamental concerns about existing theories, as well as in
new results on developing and applying automated reasoning techniques
and tools for the formal specification and analysis of security
protocols.

Possible topics include, but are not limited to:

Automated reasoning techniques       Access control and resource usage control
Composition issues                   Authentication
Formal specification                 Availability and denial of service
Foundations of verification          Covert channels
Information flow analysis            Confidentiality
Language-based security              Integrity and privacy
Logic-based design              for  Intrusion detection
Program transformation               Malicious code
Security models                      Mobile code
Static analysis                      Mutual distrust
Statistical methods                  Privacy
Tools                                Security policies
Trust management                     Security protocols

All submissions will be peer-reviewed. Authors of accepted papers must
guarantee that their paper will be presented at the workshop.

No, it has nothing to do with your machine at all. The fault was
on our side: one of the servers we currently use for the avispa
interface crashed, but it should be fine now.

Please let me know if you're still experiencing problems.

Best Regards,

Jacopo.

Hi Kamal,
 
Check with kerb-preauth.hlpsl that you have with in hlpsl folder of your
avispa installation, it may help you,
 
A question for everybody,
Can we model multicast with avispa ( I mean a multicast channel) ?
 
Thanks

Hi All,
 
Im working on modeling Kerberos-5 authentication protocol, and Im having
difficulty modeling the protocol with the authenticator being cashed (i.e.
Ticket Cashing).
 
Any help or guidance on this matter is truly appreciated.
 
Thanks,

Subject: [Avispa-users] Is it possible a valid session with the intruder?
Message-ID: <442FD1C900012208@mailserver1.itesm.mx>

Hi list,

I'm trying to find a counterexample to the Woo Lam Mutual Authentication
protocol with avispa toolkit, I know that the protocol is faulty. The counterexample
is establishing two parallel sessions with the intruder (available in http://www.lsv.ens-cachan.fr/spore/wooLamMutual.html).
 My questions is:

It is possible to do valid sessions with the intruder?, it is because until
now, avispa (ofmc and clatse) cannot obtain an attack on the Woo Lam Auth
protocol. Put differently, in this counterexample there isn't the participation
of Alice and Bob, rather, the participation is only between Alice and Intruder.
Because of that my question .....

Attached the hlspl specification of Woo Lam protocol, I hope someone may
help me ...

Thanks a lot for your trouble ..... 

Juan Carlos

Subject: [Avispa-users] A->B:K ?
Message-ID: <444F2F11.3000503@hds.utc.fr>

Dear Avispa users,
We are beginners in using Avispa.
We specified a simple protocol using HLPSL :
A-> B : K ,
where K is a secret between A and B.
We claimed that this protocol guarantees unilateral authentication.
It is easy to see that this protocol is not safe, and we expected Avispa 
to say : UNSAFE, and a trace attack would be for instance :
i->(a,3) : start
(a,3)->i : kab
i->(b,3) : kab

This is not the case. Avispa says the protocol is SAFE.
We wonder if we made a mistake in our specification. Please find attach 
to this message our HLPSL specification.
Thank you for your cooperation.

Subject: [Avispa-users] A->B : K
Message-ID: <444F35ED.8030303@hds.utc.fr>

Dear Avispa users,
We are beginners in using Avispa.
We specified a simple protocol using HLPSL :
A-> B : K ,
where K is a secret between A and B.
We claimed that this protocol guarantees unilateral authentication.
It is easy to see that this protocol is not safe, and we expected Avispa 
to say : UNSAFE, and a trace attack would be for instance :
i->(a,3) : start
(a,3)->i : kab
i->(b,3) : kab

This is not the case. Avispa says the protocol is SAFE.
We wonder if we made a mistake in our specification. Please find attach 
to this message our HLPSL specification.
Thank you for your cooperation.

Yes this is possible.  As example you can look at NSPK protocol were the

This might be due to a typo in the protocol_id constants. Namely, you
use two protocol_id "ab" and "ba" (see "step6and7" transition) that are
undeclared and that are not appropriately referenced from any of the
goal you have declared. Try to fix the problem and to run again the tools.

Hope this help. Best regards,

Why don't you check for secrecy violation instead of authentication?

indeed I think this should not interpreted as an authentication flaw. In
the end 'a' and 'b' are sure of their identity even if the intruder has
been involved in the communication.
A closer look to your specification made me think to "why don't we find
a replay attack like the following":

i->(a,3) : start
(a,3)->i : kab
i->(b,3) : kab
i->(b,10) : kab

where the intruder learns "kab" and uses it to fake 'b' in their
session.  Well the reason is that in your HLPSL specification, the
shared key is given to the agent from the beginning so that they can
refuse any communication that does not use the appropriate key. 

Hope this help.

Luca

Thanks Luca,

I have revised  in detail Woo Lam protocol, I found out that for getting 
the counter-example I was looking for, the authentication should be 
established between Alice and Server (protocol_id alice_server_kab)... 
The typo pinpointed for you also has been fixed ...

thanks again and best wishes,

Subject: [Avispa-users] May Avispa find an attack after a second one?
Message-ID: <445122FE.5090406@itesm.mx>

Hi List,

I'm verifying CCITTX509(1) protocol whose specification is one step as 
follows:

1 A --> B: A, {B, Nxa, {Nya}_Kb}_inv(Ka)

I know that the protocol is faulty, the attack should be (following the 
option -p of OFMC):

Attack 1:
i -> (a,3): start
(a,3) -> i: a.{b.Nxa(1).{Nya(1)}_kb}_inv(ka)
i -> (b,10): i.{b.x38.{Nya(1)}_kb}_inv(ki)

However, I still don't know how to find this attack, I have played in 
different way the environment role and I have only found the following 
attack:

Attack 2:
i -> (a,3): start
(a,3) -> i: a.{b.Nxa(1).{a.Nya(1)}_kb}_inv(ka)
i -> (b,3): a.{b.Nxa(1).{a.Nya(1)}_kb}_inv(ka)
i -> (b,6): a.{b.Nxa(1).{a.Nya(1)}_kb}_inv(ka)
 
I have the following assumption:
"I know that the first attack is within the branch-searched tree, maybe, 
when any backend searches for an attack, the first attack found is 
Attack 2 and maybe Attack 1 is situated after the first one". Therefore, 
I have two questions:

1. If my assumption is correct, how may I find the first attack (Attack 1)?
2. Otherwise, Will I be doing something erroneous in the hlpsl 
specification?

Attached to this message the hlpsl specification of CCITTX509(1) protocol...

I hope someone may help me ...

Thanks a lot for your trouble .....

Hi Juan Carlos,

The attack raised by the AVISPA tool shows that this protocol does not
satisfy strong authentication on Nya.  If you ask for checking weak
authentication, there will not be any attack.

About the first attack that you are looking for, I am not convinced
this is one.  Could you explain what is the property that is not
satisfied?
In the trace

 > Attack 1:
 > i -> (a,3): start
 > (a,3) -> i: a.{b.Nxa(1).{Nya(1)}_kb}_inv(ka)
 > i -> (b,10): i.{b.x38.{Nya(1)}_kb}_inv(ki)

b knows that i has sent him this message, and as i is the intruder,
there is no authentication done between b and i.

Maybe I have an erroneous idea about the role that "i" (the intruder) is 
playing with respect to "b". In the above attack I have the idea that 
"b", naively, thinks that "i" is a honest agent and "b" could 
authenticate to "i" on Nya  (same variable where "a" does a witness).  
This attack is shown in http://www.lsv.ens-cachan.fr/spore/ccittx509_1.html

If you think that I have an erroneous idea, please I will be grateful 
you tell me why...

best regards,

Juan Carlos

Hi there,

Found two specs at http://avispa-project.org/library/index.html :
http://avispa-project.org/library/SET-purchase.html
and
http://avispa-project.org/library/SET-purchase-honest-payment-gateway.html

The hlpsl spec for each is at the bottom half of the page. 

Cheers,

Ilham

hi , 
  i know that the replay attack exists on TLS protocol (since the server  decrypt all messages sent by the client )but it's not mentionned in TLS spec .
  i would like to know why.
  thx

Subject: [Avispa-users] OFMC: exponentiation support question
Message-ID: <1146489269.8544.48.camel@riset-a-s1-112.riset.cs.ui.ac.id>

Hi all,

I have been trying to verify the authentication protocol B proposed by
European Telecommunications Standard Institute and used in
authentication part of Horn-Preneel UTMSPayment protocol. 

The protocol uses exponentiation as shown in Alice-Bob model below:

U -> V: exp(g,u)
V -> U: r; h2(K; r; V); Timestamp; certV     where K = h1(exp(g,u),v)
U -> V: {Sig_U(h3(exp(g,u); exp(g,v); r; V; Timestamp; Alpha_T); certU; 
         Alpha_T}_K

h1, h2, and h3 are hash functions; u and r are nonces, while v is the
private key of V and exp(g,v) is V's public key. 

When I tested my complete model using OFMC as backend with sessco option
on, the following message appeared. 

  ofmc: OFMC can't see how the protocol can be executed.
  See manual for more information.

I have reduced the HLPSL file (attached) to a model of which this
behaviour is still observable. 

Have I used the exponentiation function incorrectly such that OFMC
rejects my specification?

Thank you very much for your trouble.

Regards,
