<PRE>
Jacopo,

thanks for your detailed reply. My comments are inline below.

Jacopo Mantovani &lt;<A HREF="http://www.avispa-project.org/mailman/listinfo/avispa-users">jacopo at dist.unige.it</A>&gt; writes:

&gt;<i> Driven by your suggestions, we have been doing many improvements
</I>&gt;<i> to the XEmacs mode:
</I>&gt;<i> - more support for semantics errors,
</I>&gt;<i> - automatic splitting of the XEmacs window in two buffers
</I>&gt;<i>    (specification and compilation) during compilation;
</I>&gt;<i> - a more rational navigation through error locations
</I>
Excellent. I am looking forward to using that. Are you planning to add
indentation support?

&gt;<i> OFMC has the option &quot;sessco&quot; (User-manual, section 3.2.2) which tries
</I>&gt;<i> to find a trace where all participants reach their final state. This
</I>&gt;<i> is not possible for protocols with any kinds of loops (as then there
</I>&gt;<i> is no such final state). Also, in the case that the protocol is not
</I>&gt;<i> executable and there is no trace where all agents reach their final
</I>&gt;<i> state, OFMC cannot give a hint where it failed. Anyway, if the
</I>&gt;<i> protocol is executable, you don't have to trace through the search
</I>&gt;<i> space with the -p option.
</I>
I didn't realise -sessco could be used to check executability. I've
tried it now, and it does indeed work. Not getting any hint as to where
it failed is, of course, somewhat unhelpful. There is also one other
problem: Executability is checked in the presence of the intruder. In
some of the examples I had tried before, the protocol itself wasn't
executable due to mismatches in the send/receive patterns. However,
since an intruder can construct messages, the protocol does become
executable in the presence of an intruder and hence -sessco does not
report any problems.

&gt;<i> Also, SATMC has an option to check executability of single rules.
</I>&gt;<i> It can be enabled by using the option
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;check_only_executability=true&quot;
</I>
The user manual doesn't mention this option. I have just tried it and it
does identify the non-executability problems I have encountered so far,
including the one I mention above. Great!

Does this check cope with (some) loops?

&gt;&gt;<i> Would it be possible to introduce a secure channel type?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, this would be a useful feature.  Unfortunately, it's rather
</I>&gt;<i> complex, both theoretically and in terms of actually implementing
</I>&gt;<i> it. We've been working on a framework for introducing different
</I>&gt;<i> channels types that we hope will be as general as possible.
</I>
I can see how the general framework would be useful, but also a lot of
work, as you say. Perhaps you could consider an interim solution where
you just get secure channels to work. Or would that be almost as hard as
the general solution?

&gt;<i> I believe we will soon make the whole web interface available for
</I>&gt;<i> download (as a separate package).
</I>
Cool.


Regards,


Matthias.
