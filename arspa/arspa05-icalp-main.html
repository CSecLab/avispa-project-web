<h2><font color=brown>Background, aim and scope</font></h2>

Experience over the last twenty years has shown that, even assuming
perfect cryptography, the design of security protocols (or cryptographic
protocols, as they are sometimes called) is highly error-prone and that
conventional validation techniques based on informal arguments and/or
testing are not up to the task.  It is now widely recognized that only
formal analysis can provide the level of assurance required by both the
developers and the users of the protocols.<p>

Work in this direction initially started in the security community but
recently there has been a tremendous progress thanks to contributions
from different automated reasoning communities, such as model checking,
resolution, planning, rewriting/narrowing, and higher-order theorem
proving. There has been another wave of progress due to research in
applying non-classical logics, such as epistemic and belief logics, to
analyze protocols and their properties. Moreover, a third stream
includes static methods, among which those based on abstract
interpretation, data and control flow analysis, and type systems proved
to be particularly successful. Finally, bisimulations and related
techniques have also been applied successfully.<p>

Based on this progress, a large number of formal methods and tools have
been developed that have been quite successful in determining strengths
and weaknesses of many protocols, i.e. in proving the correctness of the
protocols or in identifying attacks on them.<p>

The ARSPA workshop aims to bring together researchers and practitioners
from both the security and the formal methods communities, from academia
and industry, who are working on developing and applying automated
reasoning techniques and tools for the formal specification and analysis
of security protocols.<p>

Contributions are welcomed on the following topics or related ones:
<ul>
<li>Automated analysis and verification of security protocols.</li>

<li>Languages, logics and calculi for the design and specification of
security protocols.</li>

<li>Verification methods: accuracy, efficiency.</li>

<li>Decidability and complexity of cryptographic verification problems.</li>

<li>Synthesis and composition of security protocols.</li>

<li>Integration of formal security specification, refinement and
validation techniques in development methods and tools.</li>
</ul>

The workshop will provide a forum for all researchers and practitioners
who are interested in this area to share their ideas and report their
results. We thus solicit submissions of papers both on mature work and
on work in progress.<p>

All submissions will be peer-reviewed. Authors of accepted papers must
guarantee that their paper will be presented at the workshop.

href="slides-arspa05/Backes.FormalCrypto.ARSPA.ppt"><i>Justifying Formal
Methods and Cryptography under Active Attacks, and Limitations
Thereof</i></a><p>

Tool-supported proofs of security protocols typically rely on
abstractions from real cryptography by term algebras, so-called
Dolev-Yao models.  However, there was traditionally no cryptographic
justification, i.e., no theorem that said what a proof with a Dolev-Yao
abstraction implied for the real implementation, even if provably secure
cryptographic primitives are used.<br>

We show how to justify a Dolev-Yao style model under active attacks and
in arbitrary protocol environments. The justification is done by
defining an ideal system handling Dolev-Yao style terms and a
cryptographic realization with the same user interface, and by showing
that the realization is as secure as the ideal system in the sense of
reactive simulatability. The Dolev-Yao style system contains asymmetric
and symmetric encryptions, digital signatures, and MACs, and the
definition of reactive simulatability encompasses arbitrary active
attacks and enjoys general composition and property-preservation
properties. Security holds in the standard model of cryptography and
under standard assumptions of adaptively secure primitives.<br>

Furthermore, we show that hashes in their usual generality in Dolev-Yao
models cannot be proven sound with respect to their cryptographic
counterparts in the sense of reactive simulatability. For XOR we even
show that no Dolev-Yao model can be proven sound with respect to any at
least moderately natural realization of the XOR function. On the
positive side, we show that XOR can be proven sound under passive
attacks and that hash functions can be proven sound if we restrict their
usage in specific and easily checkable way.  </li><p>


<li><font color=brown>John C. Mitchell</font><br><i>Protocol Analysis:
Wireless Networking and Mobility</i><p> 

There are several kinds of automated reasoning methods for security
protocol analysis, including model checking, theorem proving, and
symbolic search methods. Our group has carried out recent case studies
using finite-state checking and a formal protocol logic, including
studies of wireless networking protocols and some approaches to network
mobility. These case studies provide interesting insight into specific
protocols and motivate improvements in the methods that are useful for
analyzing other protocols.  This talk will describe the methods, recent
progress, and case studies.  </li><p>
