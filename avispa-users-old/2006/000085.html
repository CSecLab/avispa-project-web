<PRE>Dear Michael,

I would be more than happy to share my views. Feel free to ask any 
questions.

I first used AVISPA during September 2005 at which point I believe it 
was unable to model any algebraic properties. I can't recall the precise 
construct I was modeling at the time - but it was related to the CRS'05 
electronic voting protocol. Claims have since been made (February, 2006) 
via this mailing list that user defined equations are compatible with 
OFMC. At present I haven't had the time to confirm this claim for 
myself. I will do so at some point in the future.

Having re-read my previous comments, I can see how I've caused 
confusion! They were written in note form (which are pretty difficult to 
read for anyone else). My key point are:

* AVISPA cannot model observational equivalence - to the best of my 
knowledge.

* AVISPA was previously (before Feb 2006) unable to model user defined 
equations.

For this reason I chose ProVerif as opposed to AVISPA. The inability to 
define ones own equation was the biggest flaw and has (apparently - I 
need to confirm for myself) now been incorporated into OFMC.


To give a taste for the equations I have been modelling here's a basic 
example:

R_0^r_f_0 R_1^r_f_1 S^r_v' = U^-c R_0^s_f_0 R_1^s_f_1 S^s_v'

Where U = R_0^f_0 R_1^f_1 S^v', s_f_0 = r_f_0 + c*f_0, s_f_1 = r_f_1 + 
c*f_1 and s_v' = r_v' + c*v'

To witness this fact we must realise:

R_0^r_f_0 R_1^r_f_1 S^r_v' = R_0^(-c*f_0) R_1^(-c*f_1) S^(-c*v') 
R_0^s_f_0 R_1^s_f_1 S^s_v'

As I have said, it may now be possible to model this in AVISPA.



Regards,

Ben

</I>&gt;<i> equations. (this is taken straight from my dissertation, so probably

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> CAPSL is unsuitable since it can only model authentication and
</I>&gt;<i> key-exchange. Similarly AVISPA supports only authentication and secrecy.
</I>&gt;<i> Although in theory it is possible to define one's own rules using
</I>&gt;<i> AVISPA's Intermediate Format (IF) language~\cite{AVISPA03} - which would
</I>&gt;<i> permit the modeling of further requirements - in reality such usage is
</I>&gt;<i> unsupported\footnotemark. ProVerif permits the verification of privacy
</I>&gt;<i> using observational equivalence. However, its ability is not complete
</I>&gt;<i> and thus it is commonly necessary to complete a proof by hand. Although
</I>&gt;<i> not perfect ProVerif is the only tool which meets the demands of the
</I>&gt;<i> analysis.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> \footnotetext{Sebastian M\&quot;{o}dersheim has since made claims that
</I>&gt;<i> AVISPA's \emph{On-the-Fly Model-Checker} (OFMC) back-end is now capable
</I>&gt;<i> (February, 2006) of handling user defined algebraic expressions. At the
</I>&gt;<i> time of analysis support was classified as beta and it was therefore
</I>&gt;<i> decided to utilise a tool which is known to provide the necessary
</I>&gt;<i> functionality.}
