FINAL CALL FOR PAPERS (extended deadline)

-----------------------------------------------------------------
1st International Workshop on Secure Information Systems (SIS'06)
Wisla, Poland, November 6-10, 2006
<A HREF="http://www.sis2006.pti.katowice.pl/">http://www.sis2006.pti.katowice.pl/</A>
-----------------------------------------------------------------


Extended versions of selected papers will be published as in a special
issue of the Journal of Information Assurance and Security (JIAS)
<A HREF="http://www.softcomputing.net/jias/">http://www.softcomputing.net/jias/</A>



The 1st International Workshop on Secure Information Systems (SIS'06)
will be held in Wisla, Poland on November 6-10, 2006, in conjunction
with the First International Multiconference on Computer Science and
Information Systems, <A HREF="http://www.FIMCSIT.pti.katowice.pl">http://www.FIMCSIT.pti.katowice.pl</A>

The SIS workshop is envisioned as a forum to promote the exchange of
ideas and results addressing complex security issues that arise in
modern information systems. We aim at bringing together a community of
security researchers and practitioners working in such divers areas as
networking security, antivirus protection, intrusion detection,
cryptography, security protocols, and others. We would like to promote
an integrated view at the security of information systems.

As information systems evolve, becoming more complex and ubiquitous,
issues relating to security, privacy and dependability become more
critical. At the same time, the global and distributed character of
modern computing - typically involving interconnected heterogeneous
execution environments - introduces many new and challenging engineering
and scientific problems. Providing protection against increasingly
sophisticated attacks requires strengthening the interaction between
different security communities, e.g. antivirus and networking. New
technologies lead to the emergence of new threats and attack strategies,
involving smart mobile devices, peer-to-peer networks, instant
messaging, VoIP, mesh networks or even networked consumer devices, such
as house appliances or cars. Furthermore, the increasing openness of the
communications infrastructure results in novel threats and can
jeopardize critical enterprise and public infrastructure, such as
industrial automation and process control systems. Not only it is
estimated that half of all Web applications and Internet storefronts
still contain some security vulnerabilities, but secure commerce
applications are also exposed to increasingly elaborate attacks,
including spyware, phishing and other social engineering methods.
In order to develop a secure system, security has to be considered in
all phases of the lifecycle and adequately addressed in all layers of
the system. At the same time, good engineering has to take into account
both scientific and economic aspects of every solution: the cost of
security has to be carefully measured against its benefits - in
particular the expected cost of mitigated risks. Most companies and
individuals treat security measures in information system as a
necessary, but often uncomfortable, overhead. The increasing penetration
of computing in all domains of everyday life means that security of
critical business systems is often managed and maintained by personnel
who are not knowledgeable in the field. This highlights the importance
of usability and ease of configuration of security mechanism and
protocols.

Covered topics include (but are not limited to):

* Access control
* Adaptive security
* Cryptography
* Copyright protection
* Cyberforensics
* Honeypots
* Intrusion detection
* Network security
* Privacy
* Secure commerce
