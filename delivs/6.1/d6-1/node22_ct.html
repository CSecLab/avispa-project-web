Protocol <B>IPv6-RADIUS (<SPAN CLASS="arabic">40</SPAN>)</B>, defined in [<A HREF="node41_ct.html#RFC3162" TARGET="contents">7</A>],
uses RADIUS for the purposes of authentication,
authorization and accounting in IPv6-enabled networks.
Known security vulnerabilities of the RADIUS protocol
are described in [<A HREF="node41_ct.html#RFC2608" TARGET="contents">76</A>,<A HREF="node41_ct.html#RFC2865" TARGET="contents">162</A>,<A HREF="node41_ct.html#RFC2869" TARGET="contents">161</A>].

<P>
<EM>Protocol IPv6-RADIUS should provide Fresh Key Agreement and 3P-Authorization&nbsp;
<BR>[1](G1-3,
<BR>[1]6,
<BR>[1]7,
<BR>[1]10,
<BR>[1]12).</EM>

<P>
Protocol <B>IPv6-cga (<SPAN CLASS="arabic">41</SPAN>)</B> is intended to solve one of the
most difficult security related problems that arose
during the design of IPv6, know as the <EM>address
ownership problem</EM>. Since a node is able to
autoconfigure its own IPv6 address (see
[<A HREF="node41_ct.html#RFC2462" TARGET="contents">183</A>]), the question is: ``how does a node
prove that it is allowed to use this IP address, and
that it does not belong for instance to another node?''
Cryptographically generated addresses (CGA) are IPv6
addresses where the interface identifier is generated
by hashing the address owner's public key. The address
owner can then use the corresponding private key to
assert address ownership and to sign messages sent from
the address without any additional security
infrastructure, [<A HREF="node41_ct.html#aura-cga" TARGET="contents">22</A>] (for more details and
variants, see also [<A HREF="node41_ct.html#aura-cga-paper" TARGET="contents">23</A>] and
[<A HREF="node41_ct.html#laganier-ike-ipv6-cga" TARGET="contents">103</A>]).

<P>
<EM>Protocol IPv6-cga should provide Sender Invariance&nbsp;
<BR>[1](G16).</EM>

<P>
A similar problem is the Secure Neighbor Discovery
Problem. [<A HREF="node41_ct.html#send-psreq" TARGET="contents">136</A>] discusses the IPv6
Neighbor Discovery trust models and threats.
The original solution to the problem was given in
[<A HREF="node41_ct.html#RFC2461" TARGET="contents">128</A>].
Protocol <B>send-cga (<SPAN CLASS="arabic">42</SPAN>)</B> is a protocol that uses
Cryptographically Generated Addresses to secure the
Neighbor Discovery for IP Version 6 (IPv6).
Three variants of the send-cga have been proposed:
[<A HREF="node41_ct.html#nikander-send-ipsec" TARGET="contents">137</A>] (cga header),
[<A HREF="node41_ct.html#send-cga" TARGET="contents">24</A>], and
[<A HREF="node41_ct.html#kempf-abk-nd" TARGET="contents">97</A>]
(Securing IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Using Address Based
Keys (ABKs)).

<P>
<EM>Protocol send-cga should provide Sender Invariance&nbsp;
<BR>[1](G16).</EM>

<P>
Protocol <B>HIP (<SPAN CLASS="arabic">43</SPAN>)</B> Host Identity Protocol (see
[<A HREF="node41_ct.html#moskowitz-hip" TARGET="contents">124</A>,<A HREF="node41_ct.html#moskowitz-hip-arch" TARGET="contents">123</A>,<A HREF="node41_ct.html#nikander-hip-mm" TARGET="contents">135</A>])
proposes a solution for separating the end-point
identifier and locator roles of IP addresses.  It
introduces a new Host Identity (HI) name space, based
on public keys.  The public keys are typically, but not
necessarily, self generated, as in the cga approach.

<P>
The HIP protocol permits IPv6 and IPv4 hosts to identify
each other based on the public keys, to establish a pair of
host-to-host ESP security associations using these public
keys, and to run both IPv4 and IPv6 applications
side-by-side independent of the underlying type of
connectivity.  It also allows many IPv4 applications to
communicate directly with IPv6 applications, and vice versa.

<P>
<EM>Protocol HIP should provide Fresh Key Agreement, PFS, DoS Resilience&nbsp;
<BR>[1](G1-3,
<BR>[1]7,
<BR>[1]9,
<BR>[1]10,
<BR>[1]12,
<BR>[1]15).</EM>

<P>
Protocol <B>pbk (<SPAN CLASS="arabic">44</SPAN>)</B>, Purpose-Built Keys, proposed in
[<A HREF="node41_ct.html#bradner-pbk-frame" TARGET="contents">41</A>], is a two party protocol,
played by a sender, Alice, and a receiver, Bob.  Alice
and Bob have no direct or indirect security
relationship that they can use to perform an
authenticated key agreement.  This basically means that
Alice and Bob do not both have secure channels to a
common trusted party, that they do not both have access
to a common security infrastructure, like a global PKI,
and moreover, that they do not share a common shared
secret and they have no knowledge of the correct
binding of public keys to their respective identities.
In this situation, any communication between Alice and
Bob may be manipulated by an active attacker without
Alice or Bob noticing it.  Now let us suppose that at
the beginning of an association between two parties an
initial transaction has not been tampered with.  In
this case, future transactions can be secured, providing
Bob with assurance that the source is the same one that started the
communication, although the actual identity of Alice is
not important to Bob.

<P>
The PBK framework may be explained as follows:
Before Alice initiates sending a set of packets to Bob,
Alice constructs a public/private key pair <!-- MATH
 $PBK =
(p,s)$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>PBK</I> = (<I>p</I>, <I>s</I>)</SPAN> for use later while sending packets.  This is
known as a Purpose Built Key Pair.  Alice then creates
a Purpose Built ID <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>PBID</I></SPAN> by performing a
cryptographic hash of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>p</I></SPAN>, the public part of
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>PBK</I></SPAN>.  This <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>PBID</I></SPAN> will be used as a pseudonymous
identity for Alice.  The value <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>PBID</I></SPAN> is sent along
with the initial packets and each packet is signed
using <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>s</I></SPAN>, the private part of the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>PBK</I></SPAN>. At some
point or another (we may assume, without loss of
generality, that this happens also during the initial set
up of the conversation) Alice also discloses the public
key <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>p</I></SPAN> to Bob.  Bob is able to verify that the hash
of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>p</I></SPAN> is <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>PBID</I></SPAN> and that the messages are signed
with the secret key corresponding to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>p</I></SPAN>.  Thus Bob
is assured that the messages were sent by the same node
that started the conversation.  If replay protection is
necessary, a nonce value (a monotonically increasing
value) or time-stamp may be included with the message
itself.

<P>
With luck, that is, if no active attacker
tampered with the first exchanges of the communication,
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>PBID</I></SPAN> is indeed the Purpose Built Identity created
by Alice.  Otherwise, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>PBID</I></SPAN> was constructed by an
attacker, in which case he may play a man in the middle
attack.
