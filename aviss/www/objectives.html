Information Society Technologies (IST) Programme, FET Open Assessment Project:
IST-2000-26410<p> 

Operative commencement date of contract: May 1st, 2001.
<p><hr><p>

This 1 year assessment project aims at laying the foundations of a new
generation of verification tools for automatic error detection for e-commerce
and related security protocols. To assess the potential of this technology, we
will develop a prototype verification tool incorporating inference engines based
on three promising automated deduction techniques: on-the-fly model-checking
based on lazy data-types, theorem-proving with constraints, and model-checking
based on propositional satisfiability checking.  The assessment consists of two
phases: a development phase aimed at the design and implementation of a
prototype verification tool, and an analysis phase, in which the tool (and the
techniques) will be tested and evaluated against a corpus of 50 security
protocol verification problems. This will pave the way to turning the prototype
into a mature technology, whose application in the industrial setting will be
ascertained in a follow-up, full RTD project with industry involvement.
