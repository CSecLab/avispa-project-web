<PRE>Dear AVISPA users,

I am currently working with AVISPA and would like to make a suggestion for
future development.

My work requires more than the basic functions that AVISPA provides (such as xor
and exp), thus supporting user-defined functions would be highly desirable.

According to the documentation it would appear that this is already possible, by
editing the prelude.if file, however this seems not to be the case. SATMC
appears to be the only translator which uses the prelude.if file, all other back
ends simply ignore it? Thus making it impossible to define one's own functions?
If this is not the case I would be grateful if you could provide me with further
information.

Further to the above comment I would like to add; the prelude.if file is not the
best place to put user-defined functions (for numerous reasons, which I won't go
into here - although feel free to ask). Ideally I would suggest the inclusion of
the keyword import/include within the hlpsl specification, which defines the
inclusion of a user-defined prelude (in addition to the default prelude.if).
Alternatively the additional prelude could be specified at the command line. Or
both options could be incorporated. Personally I would prefer the include/import
option.


Regards,

Ben Smyth


PS - I apologise if you receive this email twice. I have just sent it prior to
completing the sign up to this list (and it was bounced), hence why I am
resending.
