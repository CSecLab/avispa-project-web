IP Routing for Wireless/Mobile Hosts

<P>
The Mobile IP Working Group has developed routing support
to permit IP nodes to seamlessly ``roam'' among IP
subnetworks and media types. The Mobile IP method supports
transparency above the IP layer, including the maintenance
of active TCP connections and UDP port bindings.

<P>
Protocol <B>AAA-MIP (<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>)</B> is used by a mobile node to authenticate in a visited
network in order to receive service from foreign
service providers, using the Internet Authentication,
Authorization and Accounting (AAA) infrastructure..
It is defined in the Diameter Base Protocol,
[<A HREF="node41_ct.html#RFC3588" TARGET="contents">44</A>], together with the Diameter Mobile
IPv4 Application, [<A HREF="node41_ct.html#aaa-diameter-mobileip" TARGET="contents">43</A>], and
related drafts ([<A HREF="node41_ct.html#mip4-aaa-key" TARGET="contents">147</A>,<A HREF="node41_ct.html#mip4-rfc3012bis" TARGET="contents">146</A>]).
During the protocol, the Home AAA server authenticates
the mobile node (MN), (Problem: Entity
authentication), and the MN is guaranteed that he is
attached to a Foreign Agent in a ``trusted'' Visited
Domain.

<P>
As part of the exchange, three short-lived keys are
distributed: the Mobile-Home Session Key, the
Mobile-Foreign Session Key, and the Foreign-Home
Session Key.  These three keys should be secret
(Problems: Key authentication for Mobile-Home, for
Mobile-Foreign, and for Foreign-Home).

<P>
<EM>Protocol AAA-MIP should provide Fresh Key Agreement and 3P-Authorization&nbsp;
<BR>[1](G1-3,
<BR>[1]6,
<BR>[1]7,
<BR>[1]10,
<BR>[1]12).</EM>

<P>
Protocol <B>MIP-BU (<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN>)</B> is a protocol used to secure
a mobile-ip message known as a binding update (BU).
When a mobile node moves (and in other circumstances),
it sends to the correspondent a message called a binding
update (BU), describing the new care-of-address needed
to reach the mobile node directly.
This BU must be secured, as otherwise anyone could pretend that a
given mobile node had moved.
Since we cannot assume the existence of a global PKI or
other global security infrastructure, it is difficult to
secure this packet, sent by any mobile node to any other
Internet node (and those two nodes may have no previous
relationship or common security infrastructure).
What should be possible to ensure, at least in some
versions of the protocol, is that the sender of the BUs
does not change (Sender Invariance).
The protocol design of [<A HREF="node41_ct.html#mobileip-ipv6" TARGET="contents">93</A>] is
unusual and would not be considered secure by the
measures of traditional security protocol analysis.
The security of the protocol depends on the partial
reliability of the Internet routing
infrastructure. Some ``regions'' of the Internet may be
considered rather secure, and any insecurity in those
regions that could be exploited in this setting, could
also be exploited in the non-mobile case. But the only
security requirement of the BU protocol is to counter
the new threats created by mobility.
The major problem when designing an unauthenticated BU is,
surprisingly enough, the introduction of new Denial of
Service threats, see [<A HREF="node41_ct.html#AuRoAr02" TARGET="contents">25</A>].

<P>
<EM>In summary, Protocol MIP-BU should provide Sender Invariance and DoS Resilience&nbsp;
<BR>[1](G15,
<BR>[1]16).</EM>
