<PRE>Dear Ben

  - HLPSL/IF have a large expressiveness, basically we can formulate all
kinds of distributed systems and also custom goals

  - There are quite different back-ends connected to AVISPA, allowing us
to perform verification both for a small number of sessions of
complicated protocols and goals, and (like ProVerif) an unbounded
number of sessions for simple protocols and secrecy.

  - Cl-AtSe and OFMC avispa back ends can handle algebraic properties, 
as Cl-AtSe has efficient implementations for the most popular 
properties, and OFMC allows the user to even specify his custom 
algebraic theory. This helps when modelling new cryptographic primitives 
or abstracting away details of the protocol.

  - also i dont understand the connection you made in your mail
  between the limitations on  properties like
  authentication and secrecy and the algebraic expressions;
  note also that since ProveriF is based on applied pi
  calculus it may need  more equational presentations
  (e.g. for standard encryption/decryption) where for avispa it is 
built-in; i am not completely sure about that but it might be the source 
of the confusion.

- maybe it would be useful for all  if you show  samples of  the 
equational properties you need to model , so that we can compare the 
different techniques

  best regards

  michael

Bonjour,

My french is no good, so I will try to write in basic English.

You need to use the best tool (program) for the job (task). I could not
find anything about CASPER or EVA, do you have the web address?

Here is my argument for using ProVerif in favour of AVISPA and CAPSL. My
goals are: prove that a state is unreachable (secrecy) and demonstrate
privacy using observational equivalence. I need to be able to define
equations. (this is taken straight from my dissertation, so probably
isn't basic english. Its in LaTeX format)

CAPSL is unsuitable since it can only model authentication and
key-exchange. Similarly AVISPA supports only authentication and secrecy.
Although in theory it is possible to define one's own rules using
AVISPA's Intermediate Format (IF) language~\cite{AVISPA03} - which would
permit the modeling of further requirements - in reality such usage is
unsupported\footnotemark. ProVerif permits the verification of privacy
using observational equivalence. However, its ability is not complete
and thus it is commonly necessary to complete a proof by hand. Although
not perfect ProVerif is the only tool which meets the demands of the
analysis.

\footnotetext{Sebastian M\&quot;{o}dersheim has since made claims that
AVISPA's \emph{On-the-Fly Model-Checker} (OFMC) back-end is now capable
(February, 2006) of handling user defined algebraic expressions. At the
time of analysis support was classified as beta and it was therefore
decided to utilise a tool which is known to provide the necessary
functionality.}


au revior,

Ben
