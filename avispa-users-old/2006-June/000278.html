			Call for Papers
	Workshop on Information and Computer Security ICS 2006
		    Timisoara, Romania
		   September 29-30, 2006

The ICS 2006 Workshop, to be held in conjunction with the 8th
International Symposium on Symbolic and Numeric Algorithms for Scientific
Computing (SYNASC 2006), is intended as an international forum&#160;for
researchers in all areas of information and computer security. Submissions
of papers presenting original research are invited for the following
workshop tracks:&#160;

Formal methods in security
  Decidability and complexity
  Language-based security
  Security models
  Security protocols
  Security verification

Security policies and services
  Authentication
  Anonymity and privacy
  Electronic voting
  Information flow
  Intrusion detection
  Resource usage control
  Security for mobile computing
  Trust management

Cryptology: We are particularly interested in work that can help build
bridges between cryptology and the other two tracks. Examples of this
include, but are not limited to:
  - Protocols that provide services in application fields such as
    e-government, and that are defined precisely enough to be used as
    reasonable targets for formal analysis tools;
  - Implementations of cryptographic primitives that can be formally
    analyzed; Work on combinatorial optimization problems that arise in
    cryptographic applications and that can be approximately solved using
    techniques from formal modeling.

Submission and Proceedings
Details about the submission procedure can be found on the workshop web
page: <A HREF="http://ics.ieat.ro/.">http://ics.ieat.ro/.</A>  Pre-proceedings will be available during the
workshop; post-proceedings will be published by Elsevier as a special
issue of Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science.

Important Dates
Deadline: July 16 (extended)
Acceptance: August 28
Camera-ready version: September 10
Workshop: September 29-30, 2006
