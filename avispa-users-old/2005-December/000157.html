<PRE>Hello,

 

How are you?  I am taking the (part time) MSc in Information Security at
Royal Holloway University of London.  I would appreciate any comments or
suggestions that you have regarding my initial ideas as described below.

 

I would like to do my MSc project (to be completed by 8 September 2006)
on mathematical analysis of security protocols.  The BAN logic (Mike
Burrows, Martin Abadi, and Roger Needham) may provide a good starting
point since it was the first and is probably the most famous analytical
method.  However, there are other formal methodologies.  Some suitable
websites that I have found as a result of an initial search are as
follows (although I have not investigated them very deeply at present):

 

*         <A HREF="http://www.avispa-project.org/">http://www.avispa-project.org/</A> (of course)

*         <A HREF="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/lcp/papers/protocols.html">http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/lcp/papers/protocols.html</A>

*         <A HREF="http://www.stcatz.ox.ac.uk/academic_staff_pages/lowe_gavin.htm">http://www.stcatz.ox.ac.uk/academic_staff_pages/lowe_gavin.htm</A>

*
<A HREF="http://portal.surrey.ac.uk/portal/page?_pageid=798,332537&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_s">http://portal.surrey.ac.uk/portal/page?_pageid=798,332537&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_s</A>
chema=PORTAL

*         And many others!!!

 

It would be interesting to see if the newer methods can find known (and
possibly additional) vulnerabilities that have already been found by
utilisation of the traditional methods, but perhaps shorter, faster or
more elegantly.  It may also be interesting to see whether security
protocols that have not yet been formally analysed could be subjected to
modern mathematical analyses.  To find a significant vulnerability in a
relatively new protocol would be an excellent bonus for this MSc
project, although the time constraints may preclude this eventuality.

 

In addition to the MSc in Information Security which is in progress at
present, my formal academic &amp; professional qualifications are as
follows:

 

*         BSc, Grade II(i), Pure Mathematics, University of Kent, 1984.

*         MPhil (by thesis), Mathematical Logic, University of
Nottingham, 1987.

*         BCS ISEB Certificate in Information Security Management
Principles, 2000.

*         Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP),
2004.

*         (plus many other smaller/specialised security courses and
training.)

 

A brief overview of my career and experience is as follows.  In the
Systems Assurance Division of EDS in the early 1990s I was in a team
that developed a Z tool in Lisp on Sun workstations, for CESG.  Then I
moved into projects performing safety critical static source code
analysis using SPADE and MALPAS.  We also developed a proprietary static
code analysis tool written initially in Prolog and then completely
rewritten in SML.  After that I joined the CLEF part of EDS to do an
ITSEC E3 evaluation of a database.  In 1996 I joined the Logica CLEF to
do further ITSEC and Common Criteria evaluations covering operating
systems, databases, firewalls, crypto tools, etc.  From 2000 to 2002 I
worked for Platform 7 Limited (which was bought by Datacard) on smart
card security.  I am currently in the LogicaCMG CLEF at Leatherhead,
doing Common Criteria security evaluations and consultancy.

 

Thanks in advance for your general comments on the above.

 

I look forward to your reply.

 

Bhavin.
