Usually each Web Service requires its own sign-on
procedure where each user must present his own user
name and password. This results in a cumbersome user
experience.  What users would like to be able to do is
to sign-on only once to a set of related services and
then freely move between them, although they may be
located on multiple servers or even in different domains. This is
known as Single-Sign-On (SSO).  LAP tries to provide
a SSO solution by specifying a simple but secure
mechanism for ``federating'' identities (a system for
binding multiple accounts for a given user).

<P>
One of the core pieces in this architecture
is the
Protocol <B>lap-lecp (<SPAN CLASS="arabic">76</SPAN>)</B> presented in [<A HREF="node41_ct.html#liberty-lecp-profile" TARGET="contents">107</A>] (for further
discussion, see also [<A HREF="node41_ct.html#TWSS" TARGET="contents">156</A>]).

<P>
<EM>Protocol lap-lecp should provide Fresh Key Agreement, 3P-Authorization, and ID Protection (Eavesdropper and Peer)&nbsp;
