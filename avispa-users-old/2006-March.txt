hello
  can you give me documentation .
  How to specify a protocol in HLPSL 
  I readed the tutorial and user-manual but it's not clear . Especially  what i put in the environnement role(): in some exemple we make three  session P,S and I,S and P,I
  P:peer
  S:server
  I:intruder
  
  and in some exemple we put only two session that are identical P,S and P,S
  
  thanks for help

Hello,

What sorts of sessions you want depends on the protocol and what  
sorts of attacks you think the protocol might be vulnerable to.  And  
also what sorts of assumptions you have on your protocol.

For instance, in the example you list, the session P,I has the  
intruder playing the role of the server.  Many protocols assume that  
the server is trusted and not compromised, so if we are working with  
this assumption then there is no need to analyze a session where the  
intruder plays the role of the server.  (If you do, you may of course  
find attacks, but they may be trivial.)

So if you have an authentication protocol between A and B which you  
want to analyze for vulnerability to Man-in-the-middle attacks,  
sessions between (A,B) (A,I) and (I,B) are good bets.  Two identical  
sessions between (A,B) and (A,B) are useful to look for replay-style  
attacks.

I realize this is a bit of a heuristic, but it can be useful to  
experiment with different analysis scenarios in order to give  
yourself greater confidence in your protocol.

I hope this helps,
Paul.

Subject: [Avispa-users] ARTIST2 Workshop on Security Specification and
 Verification of Embedded Systems
Message-ID: <4418368F.3090706@lsv.ens-cachan.fr>

*** Apologies for multiple copies ***

Dear colleague,

We wish to invite you to participate to the ARTIST-2 informal workshop
on security of embedded systems. ARTIST-2 is a European Network of
Excellence on Embedded Systems Design (http://www.artist-embedded.org/FP6/).

The workshop will focus on the formal specification and verification
of security properties, and in particular on the specification and
formal verification of security protocols. Topics include, but are not
limited to:

    * formal definition and verification of security properties
    * formal analysis and design of cryptographic protocols
    * modeling information flow
    * formal techniques for (mobile) code security;
    * security in real-time/probabilistic systems;
    * language-based security;
    * theory and application of policy languages and trust management

One of the goals of the workshop is to bring together the part of the
Artist2 community working on security, nevertheless, the workshop is
open to anyone.

The program of the workshop will include invited talks, regular talks
and plenty of time for discussion. We expect to include both short
(~10-20 minutes) and long (~40-50 minutes) talks.

The workshop will take place at Pisa, Tuscany, Italy on May 18th and
will be co-located with iTrust2006 (http://www.iit.cnr.it/iTrust2006/).

If you are interested in giving a talk, please send an email before
April 7 to

    artist2-sw@iit.cnr.it

indicating a title, a short abstract (one or two paragraphs) and
whether you intend to give a long or a short talk.

The participation to the workshop is free but registration is
mandatory. Updated information will be accessible at the workshop
website:

Hi List --

1. Could someone point to more AVISPA examples on password-based
protocols (in addition to SRP, EKE, SPEKE available in the current
distribution)?

2. What are the differences between a parameter declared in a "role"
and inside a role as a "local" variable?

Thanks for your time.

Hi Mohammad,

This is exactly the same difference as between a parameter and a local
variable in the declaration of a function: a parameter is an
information comming from the outside; it is instantiated when the role
is called; a local variable belongs only to the role where it is
defined, and it may not have an initial value.

Laurent.

Bonjour,

  y a t-il de documentation qui explique les arguments de choisir AVISPA. ?

Subject: [Avispa-users] about 'secrecy' statement and Kerberos
Message-ID: <20060330084406.GA10101@mlserv.jaist.ac.jp>

Hi, 

In the user-manual (p.26 guidelines about secrecy goal specification)
, it is said that "If a value T that should be kept secret is
determined by a single role (in particular, if it is an atomic value
like a nonce produced by new()), then the secrecy statement should
be given in -- and only in -- the role introducing the value".

In case of Kerberos, the TGS session key (the key that will be
shared between a client and the TGS) is generated by the AS,
hence the secrecy statement related to TGS sessoin should be present
only on the AS role.

However, in the example "Kerbers-basic" provided in the "The AVISPA
Library of protocols" the secrecy statement of TGS session key is
present in the AS, TGS and the client.


So, I guess that one of the following is true :

- I did not understood what is said in the HLPSL guidelines
- There is a mistake in the HLPSL specification of Kerberos-basic


I would appreciate any clarifications,


Regards,
Saber.

Bonjour,

My french is no good, so I will try to write in basic English.

You need to use the best tool (program) for the job (task). I could not 
find anything about CASPER or EVA, do you have the web address?

Here is my argument for using ProVerif in favour of AVISPA and CAPSL. My 
goals are: prove that a state is unreachable (secrecy) and demonstrate 
privacy using observational equivalence. I need to be able to define 
equations. (this is taken straight from my dissertation, so probably 
isn't basic english. Its in LaTeX format)

CAPSL is unsuitable since it can only model authentication and 
key-exchange. Similarly AVISPA supports only authentication and secrecy. 
Although in theory it is possible to define one's own rules using 
AVISPA's Intermediate Format (IF) language~\cite{AVISPA03} - which would 
permit the modeling of further requirements - in reality such usage is 
unsupported\footnotemark. ProVerif permits the verification of privacy 
using observational equivalence. However, its ability is not complete 
and thus it is commonly necessary to complete a proof by hand. Although 
not perfect ProVerif is the only tool which meets the demands of the 
analysis.

\footnotetext{Sebastian M\"{o}dersheim has since made claims that 
AVISPA's \emph{On-the-Fly Model-Checker} (OFMC) back-end is now capable 
(February, 2006) of handling user defined algebraic expressions. At the 
time of analysis support was classified as beta and it was therefore 
decided to utilise a tool which is known to provide the necessary 
functionality.}


au revior,

Ben
