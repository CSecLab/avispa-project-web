<PRE>Dear Matthias,

in this e-mail I try to collect all issues and answers that you
arose in your posting of the 14th of July.

you wrote:
&gt;<i> I have been playing with AVISPA for the past few days. Overall my
</I>&gt;<i> impressions are very positive. It is a great piece of software, the
</I>&gt;<i> installation is painless, the documentation is good and overall I found
</I>&gt;<i> it a lot easier to use than some of the other tools in the same space.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I do, however, have a few gripes:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * The xemacs mode. It does a great job of syntax highlighting. However,
</I>&gt;<i> it is suffering from the following shortcomings/bugs:
</I>&gt;<i>   - no indentation support
</I>&gt;<i>   - the buffer refresh in the compile cycle is erratic - sometimes the
</I>&gt;<i> result buffers refresh automatically, sometimes they don't, and at other
</I>&gt;<i> times I get duplicate buffers (..&lt;2&gt; etc)
</I>&gt;<i>   - the compilation does not report any errors; one can find them by
</I>&gt;<i> switching to the compilation buffer, but that is not at all obvious
</I>&gt;<i>   - the error locations in the compilation buffer are not of a format
</I>&gt;<i> that emacs recognises, which makes navigating to error locations
</I>&gt;<i> difficult
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Driven by your suggestions, we have been doing many improvements
to the XEmacs mode:
- more support for semantics errors,
- automatic splitting of the XEmacs window in two buffers
   (specification and compilation) during compilation;
- a more rational navigation through error locations

All of these improvements will be available in the next release of
the Avispa Tool for sure.


&gt;<i> * Non-executable models. As mentioned in the manual &amp; tutorial, and
</I>&gt;<i> evidenced by my own observations, it is very easy to make mistakes that
</I>&gt;<i> result in the model becoming partially un-executable and the model
</I>&gt;<i> checker consequently reporting success. The tutorial suggests using the
</I>&gt;<i> -p option to step through the states. However, that is extremely tedious
</I>&gt;<i> for anything but the most trivial models.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Would it be possible to perform an automated check that all transitions
</I>&gt;<i> in a model are reachable and can fire? That, I think, would catch most
</I>&gt;<i> of the cases of non-executable models.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
In fact, there already are two tools that can perform such a check:

OFMC has the option &quot;sessco&quot; (User-manual, section 3.2.2) which tries
to find a trace where all participants reach their final state. This
is not possible for protocols with any kinds of loops (as then there
is no such final state). Also, in the case that the protocol is not
executable and there is no trace where all agents reach their final
state, OFMC cannot give a hint where it failed. Anyway, if the
protocol is executable, you don't have to trace through the search
space with the -p option.

Also, SATMC has an option to check executability of single rules.
It can be enabled by using the option

&quot;check_only_executability=true&quot;

We'll surely think about making these checks automatic.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * Secure channels. Currently, the only type of channel supported by the
</I>&gt;<i> modelling language are Dolev-Yao channels. For modelling complex systems
</I>&gt;<i> I find myself wanting to decompose roles into smaller entities but since
</I>&gt;<i> the insecure D-Y channels are the only form of communication available
</I>&gt;<i> this introduces spurious vulnerabilities.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The same problem arises more generally when trying to model systems
</I>&gt;<i> where parts of the communication are impervious to attack. Would it be
</I>&gt;<i> possible to introduce a secure channel type?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>Yes, this would be a useful feature.  Unfortunately, it's rather complex, both 
theoretically and in terms of actually implementing it. We've been working on 
a framework for introducing different channels types that we hope will be as 
general as possible.  Instead of extending the system each time we want a new 
channel type, we'd like a general way of describing what capabilities an 
intruder can have on a channel and then be able to give a new channel type 
simply by describing a combination of those capabilities.  This is in the 
pipeline but will require quite a bit of work, so for the immediate future I'm 
afraid the only option is to specify such &quot;secure&quot; communication as happening 
within a monolithic role.


&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * Web interface. The downloadable distribution of AVISPA does not appear
</I>&gt;<i> to contain the web interface and the trace-&gt;msc converter. Would it be
</I>&gt;<i> possible to make these available?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>There is no particular problem with that. I believe we will soon make
the whole web interface available for download (as a separate package).
By the way, it is likely that we will release also a new version
of the avispa tool with minor corrections and improvements within
this year. Further strategies for managing future releases of the
tool are still under discussion.

Best Regards,

Jacopo.
