EAP

<P>
The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) framework,
described in [<A
 HREF="node41.html#eap-rfc2284bis">37</A>,<A
 HREF="node41.html#eap-keying">3</A>,] and other drafts, provides a standard
mechanism for support of additional authentication
methods within PPP, IEEE 802 wired networks, IEEE
802.11 (with IEEE 802.1X) or other access technology.

<P>
The Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol
(Version 2), Protocol <B>PEAP (20)</B>, provides an encrypted and
authenticated tunnel based on transport layer security
(TLS) that encapsulates EAP (Extensible Authentication
Protocol) authentication mechanisms.
[<A
 HREF="node41.html#josefsson-pppext-eap-tls-eap">94</A>]

<P>
<EM>Protocol PEAP should provide Fresh Key Agreement, 3P-Authorization, and ID Protection (Eavesdropper)&nbsp;(G1-3,6,7,10,12,13).</EM>

<P>
The PEAP conversation occurs between the EAP peer and
EAP server, passing through a Network Access Server,
NAS.  The NAS is not involved in the PEAP conversation,
which is confidentially protected, and therefore the
NAS does not have knowledge of the TLS master secret
derived between the peer and the EAP server.  In order
to provide keying material for link-layer purposes, the
NAS obtains the master session key, which is derived
from a one-way function of the TLS master secret as
well as keying material provided by EAP methods.  This
enables the NAS and EAP peer to subsequently derive
transient session keys suitable for encrypting,
authenticating and integrity protecting session data.
However, the NAS cannot decrypt the PEAPv2 conversation
or spoof session resumption, since this requires
knowledge of the TLS master secret.

<P>
The protocol is quite complex and includes 2 different
parts, each one with several phases and variants:
The first part is as follows: The initial identity
exchange is used primarily to route the EAP
conversation to the EAP server.  Then a TLS session is
established.  TLS itself has several variants,
depending in particular on the type of credentials
used.  If required for privacy reasons, the TLS session
may be re-negotiated after the first server
authentication.  Then a version negotiation procedure
enables PEAP implementations to be backward compatible
with previous versions of the protocol.  It should
guarantee that the EAP peer and server will agree to
the latest version supported by both parties.
There is also a variant
for resuming a previously
   established session.
The second part of the PEAPv2 conversation typically
consists of a complete EAP conversation occurring
within the TLS session negotiated in Part 1.
Besides being a standard Key Exchange Problem, TLS
also offers identity
protection against eavesdroppers.

<P>
Protocol <B>EAP-SIM (21)</B>, the EAP SIM Authentication of
[<A
 HREF="node41.html#haverinen-pppext-eap-sim">82</A>], is an authentication
and session key distribution method based on the GSM
Subscriber Identity Module SIM mechanism, a
challenge/response authentication and key agreement
procedure based on a symmetric 128-bit pre-shared
secret. EAP SIM also makes use of a peer challenge, not
part of GSM, to provide mutual authentication.
EAP-SIM specifies optional support for version
negotiation and for protecting the privacy of
the subscriber identity using the same concept as GSM,
which uses pseudonyms/temporary identifiers.  This
protocol is also quite complex and includes Version
Negotiation, Identity Management, Re-Authentication,
EAP Notifications, Error Case Handling, and Key
Generation, all including several phases and variants.

<P>
<EM>Protocol EAP-SIM should provide Fresh Key Agreement and 3P-Authorization&nbsp;(G1-3,6,7,10,12).</EM>

<P>
Protocol <B>EAP-AKA (22)</B>, the EAP AKA Authentication, proposed
in [<A
 HREF="node41.html#arkko-pppext-eap-aka">15</A>], is a mechanism for
authentication and session key distribution using the
Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS)
Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA) mechanism. UMTS
AKA is based on symmetric keys and typically runs in a
UMTS Subscriber Identity Module, a smart card like
device.  EAP AKA includes optional identity privacy
support, an optional re-authentication procedure, EAP
Notifications, Error Case Handling, Key Generation,
and the protocol exists in different variants.

<P>
Each of the 2 protocols offers us a wide range of
security problems: Identity Protection, Mutual
Authentication, Key Derivation, Brute-Force and
Dictionary Attacks, Integrity Protection, Replay
Protection and Confidentiality, Negotiation Attacks.

<P>
<EM>Protocol EAP-AKA should provide Fresh Key Agreement, 3P-Authorization, and ID Protection (Eavesdropper and Peer)&nbsp;(G1-3,6,7,10,12-14).</EM>

<P>
Protocol <B>EAP-Archie (23)</B>, the EAP Archie Protocol, defined
in [<A
 HREF="node41.html#jwalker-eap-archie">201</A>], performs mutual
authentication, and fresh session key
derivation. EAP-Archie is based on a static long-lived
512-bit secret, the Archie Key, shared between the two
main entities in the protocol, the EAP Peer and the EAP
Server. The Archie Key consists of two 128-bit sub-keys
and a 256-bit sub-key, respectively called the
key-confirmation key (KCK), the key-encryption key
(KEK), and the key-derivation key (KDK). The protocol
uses the KCK to mutually authenticate the EAP Peer and
the EAP Server, the KEK to distribute secret nonces
used for session key derivation, and the KDK to derive
a session key between the EAP Peer and the EAP
Server.

<P>
<EM>Protocol EAP-Archie should provide Fresh Key Agreement, 3P-Authorization, and DoS Resilience&nbsp;(G1-3,6,7,10,12,15).</EM>

<P>
Newly discovered Man-in-the-middle attacks in the
context of tunneled authentication protocols (see
[<A
 HREF="node41.html#puthenkulam-eap-binding">157</A>] and
[<A
 HREF="node41.html#mim-tunnelled">18</A>]) are applicable to IKEv2 if
legacy authentication with EAP is used
([<A
 HREF="node41.html#ipsec-ikev2">95</A>,<A
 HREF="node41.html#RFC2284">38</A>]). To counter this threat
Protocol <B>EAP-IKEv2 (24)</B> was designed
([<A
 HREF="node41.html#tschofenig-eap-ikev2">191</A>]), providing a session
key inside the AUTH payload.

<P>
EAP-IKEv2 consists of three parts plus an optional DoS
protection exchange.

<P>
<EM>Protocol EAP-IKEv2 should provide Fresh Key Agreement, 3P-Authorization, and DoS Resilience&nbsp;(G1-3,6,7,10,12,15).</EM>

<P>
Protocol <B>EAP-TTLS (25)</B>, the EAP Tunneled TLS
Authentication Protocol, is defined in
[<A
 HREF="node41.html#pppext-eap-ttls">71</A>] (see also
[<A
 HREF="node41.html#RFC2716">5</A>]).

<P>
<EM>Protocol EAP-TTLS should provide Fresh Key Agreement and 3P-Authorization&nbsp;(G1-3,6,7,10,12).</EM>
