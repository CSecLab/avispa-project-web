  <h2>The AVISPA-USERS mailing list</h2>
  
  <h3>Overview</h3>

  <p>
  Aim of the <b>avispa-users</b> mailing list is to collect technical
  questions, bugs, proposals, and user requests about the AVISPA Tool
  and the techniques implemented within.

  <p>
  Also, new releases and other important events for AVISPA will be
  announced on this list.

  <h3>Mailing list manager</h3>

  <p>
  The <b>avispa-users</b> mailing list manager is GNU <a
  href="http://www.gnu.org/software/mailman"
  target="_blank">Mailman</a>. Parts of this page are excerpts of the
  Mailman documentation, available at <a
  href="http://www.gnu.org/software/mailman/users.html" target="_blank">this link</a>.

  </p>

  
  <h3>Policy of the list</h3>

  <p>
  In order to be able to post to the mailing list, you MUST SUBSCRIBE
  FIRST. To get off the mailing list, you must unsubscribe. If you
  post to the list without subscribing first, the posting will be
  ignored (in fact, you won't even get a reply, in order to prevent
  abuse by spammers). YOU MUST SUBSCRIBE BEFORE POSTING.

  <p>
  Before posting to the mailing list, please read the relevant product
  manual and search the mailing list archives for similar questions
  and answers posted by others.

  <p>
  Mailing list postings until December 2006 are archived <a
  href="avispa-users-old" target="main">here</a>. Since 2007 they are
  archived <a href="http://pop.avispa-project.org/pipermail/avispa-users"
  target="main">here</a>.


  <p>
  In case you are worried about spam, no spam messages from the
  <b>avispa-users</b> list will reach you, since only members of the
  list can send e-mails through it. The rest of the messages coming
  from 'outside' the list are held and in case discarded.
  
  <p>
  The list is not moderated, but it is continuously monitored.

  The list is not to be used by subscribers to solicit commercial
  services or promote products or send spam. Doing so will result in
  immediate and permanent removal of the offender's subscription.

  Abusive or offensive postings will also result in immediate and
  permanent removal of the offender's subscription.

  <h3>Subscribing and unsubscribing</h3>


  <p>
  There are two common ways you can subscribe to the <b>avispa-users</b> mailing list. 

  </p><p>
  Using the web interface:

  </p><ol>

  <li>Go to the list information page for <b>avispa-users</b> :the
	address is <a class="url"
	href="http://pop.avispa-project.org/mailman/listinfo/avispa-users"
	target="main">http://pop.avispa-project.org/mailman/listinfo/avispa-users</a>
	</li>

  <li>Look for the section marked ``Subscribing to avispa-users'' and
	fill in the boxes.  You can fill in the following: <li>
	
	<ul>
	<li>You <i>must</i> enter your email address.</li>
	<li>You may choose to supply your real name.</li>
	<li>You may choose a password.   If you do not choose one, Mailman will
		 generate one for you.  

		 <p>
		 <span class="warning"><b class="label">Warning:</b>
		 Do NOT use a valuable password, since this password
		 may occasionally be mailed to you in plain text.
		 </span>
		 </p>

	</li>
	<li>The list supports more than one language, and you can choose your
                 preferred language.

		 <span class="note"><b class="label">Note:</b> This
		 setting does not affect posts to the list, only
		 Mailman texts that come from the list software, such
		 as your member options page.</span>
	
	</li>
	</ul>
  </li>

  <li>Press the subscribe button.  A new page should appear telling
	you that your subscription request has been received.  This
	page will provide you with further instructions, such as the
	need to wait for and reply to a confirmation messages,
	depending on the list's subscription policies.  </li> </ol>

<p>
Using the email interface:

</p>
<ol>

<li>Open a mail program which sends mail from the address you want to
    subscribe.</li>

<li>Send a mail to the list subscription address, which is in the form
    avispa-users-join at avispa-project dot org.
   The subject and body of the message will be ignored, so it doesn't
   matter what you put there.  </li> 
</ol>

<p>
After following one of these sets of instructions (you don't need to
do both!), you will receive an email message asking for confirmation
that you really want to be subscribed to the list.  This is to prevent
anyone from subscribing you to lists without your permission.  Follow
the instructions given in the message to confirm your wish to be
subscribed.
</p>

<p>
Once this is done, you will likely receive another message welcoming you to
the list.  This message contains some useful information including your list
password and some quick links for changing your options, so you may want to
save it for later reference.
</p>

<P>
If you actually want to leave the list, there are two common ways you can
unsubscribe from a Mailman mailing list.

<P>
Using the web interface:

<OL>
<LI>Go to the list information page for the list you want to leave.
(The address is <a class="url"
href="http://pop.avispa-project.org/mailman/listinfo/avispa-users"
target="main">http://pop.avispa-project.org/mailman/listinfo/avispa-users</a>)
</LI>
<LI>Look for the section marked ``avispa-users subscribers'' (usually found 
	near the bottom of the page).
</LI>
<LI>There should be a button marked ``Unsubscribe or Edit Options.''  
	Enter your email address in the box beside this button and press the
	button.
</LI>
<LI>You should be brought to a new page which has an ``Unsubscribe''
	button.  Press it to unsubscribe and follow the instructions given.
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
Using the email interface:

<OL>
<LI>Open a mail program which sends mail from the address you want to 
	unsubscribe.
</LI>
<LI>Send a mail to the list unsubscribe address, which will be of the form
	<span class="email">avispa-users-leave@avispa-project.org</span>.  
	The subject and body
	of this message will be ignored, so it doesn't matter what you put there.

</LI>
</OL>

<P>
After following one of these sets of instructions (you don't need to do
both!), you will be sent a confirmation mail and must follow the
instructions given in that mail to complete the unsubscription.  This is to
stop people from unsubscribing you without your permission.  In addition, a
moderator may need to approve your unsubscription.  (Administrator-approved
unsubscriptions are uncommon.)

<P>
If you do not receive this confirmation mail with instructions, make sure
that you typed your email address correctly (if you were using the web 
interface to unsubscribe) and that the address you tried
to unsubscribe is, indeed, actually subscribed to that list.  For security
reasons, Mailman generates the same member options page regardless of
whether the address entered is subscribed or not.  This means that people
cannot use this part of the web interface to find out if someone is
subscribed to the list, but it also means that it's hard to tell if you just
made a typo.

<P>
Once your unsubscription has been processed, you will probably receive
another message confirming your unsubscription from the list, and at that
point you should stop receiving messages.
