                      Workshop on Collaboration and Security
                                   (COLSEC'06)

                       The 2006 International Symposium on
                 Collaborative Technologies and Systems (CTS'06)
                                 May 14-17, 2006
                              Las Vegas, Nevada, USA

   -------------------------------------------------------------------------
                      Submission Deadline: February 7, 2006
   -------------------------------------------------------------------------


Brief Description:

Collaboration relies on distributed systems that provide the required
security properties.  Virtual organizations often use the Internet to
support collaboration.  The Internet, operating systems and distributed
environments currently suffer from poor security support and cannot resist
common attacks (spamming, worms, session hijacking, buffer overflow, denial
of service, social engineering, etc.).  Collaborative organizations require
better security properties (strong authentication, efficient encryption,
Mandatory Access Control, insurance of confidentiality, integrity,
non-repudiation and availability).  Nowadays, collaborative organizations
use new technologies such as mobile devices, smartcards, wireless networks,
high performance networks and grid computing.  These environments introduce
new needs, requirements and difficulties related to security.  Hence,
collaborative organizations and technologies face several challenges in the
field of security.

This Workshop on Security and Collaboration - to be held as part of the 2006
International Symposium on Collaborative Technologies and Systems (CTS'06) -
will focus on security issues related to collaborative systems with emphasis
on distributed environments, smartcards, grid or clustering systems for
cooperation, mobile and wireless cooperation.  The aim is to have a
dedicated workshop that fosters closer interactions among researchers and
users communities, providing an excellent opportunity for them to meet and
discuss their ideas.  It addresses specifically relationships between
collaborative systems and security.  It intends to present new challenges
and solutions related to latest security requirements, specific methods of
access control enabling large scale cooperation, usage of mobile
technologies and smartcards, new security infrastructures supporting better
prevention, detection, recovery and healing in the context of cooperative
systems.  It will also consider security in different domains of application
(e.g., e-Government, e-Business, Public Services, P2P, e-Social Security,
Medical Collaboration, ...).

We invite original contributions from researchers in academia, research
institutions and industry on these emerging and important areas of
information technology.

Workshop topics include, but are not limited to, the following:
* Frameworks for Security in Collaborative Systems
* Access Control in Collaborative Environments
* Trusted Operating Systems for Distributed Environments
* Security of Grid and Cluster Architectures Supporting Cooperative
      Applications
* Honeypots for Collaborative Systems
*  Intrusion and Attacks Detection for Collaborative Systems
* Role Based, Reputation, and Trust
* Encryption and Cryptography Systems Supporting Cooperative Systems
* Use of Smartcards in the Context of Collaboration
* Security in Mobile and Wireless Networks
* Disclosure and Integrity Issues
* Resistance to Denial of Service
* Detection and Self-Recovery Schemes and Strategies Supporting Cooperation
* Security for Specific Collaboration Domains (e.g., e-Government,
      e-Business, Public Services, P2P, e-Social Security, Medical
      Collaboration)

Submission Instructions:

Papers reporting original and unpublished research results on above and any
other related topics are solicited.  Submission should include a cover page
with authors' names, affiliations, addresses, fax and phone numbers, and
email addresses.  Please indicate clearly the corresponding author.  Include
up to 6 keywords from the above list and an abstract of no more than 300
words.  Please submit a PDF copy of your full manuscript (not to exceed 15
double-spaced pages including figures, tables, and references, or not to
exceed 8 pages in length in single-space, two columns IEEE format Conference
style) to <A HREF="http://www.avispa-project.org/mailman/listinfo/avispa-users">christian.toinard at ensi-bourges.fr</A> and
<A HREF="http://www.avispa-project.org/mailman/listinfo/avispa-users">jean-francois.lalande at ensi-bourges.fr.</A>  Electronic submissions will be
accepted only in PDF format, sent at the email address above or uploaded at
<A HREF="http://www.univ-orleans.fr/lifo/Manifestations/CTS2006/COLSEC2006/.">http://www.univ-orleans.fr/lifo/Manifestations/CTS2006/COLSEC2006/.</A>  For
other electronic formats, please check with the organizers.

Consistent with standard practice, each submitted paper will receive a
minimum of three reviews.  Papers will be selected based on their
originality, timeliness, significance, relevance, and clarity of
presentation.  Initial selection will be based on full papers.  Submission
implies the willingness of at least one of the authors to register and
present the paper, if accepted.  All accepted papers in the Workshop are
required to be presented and will be included in the Symposium proceedings.
It is our intent to have the proceedings formally published in hard and soft
copies and be available at the time of the conference.

Further instructions will be provided at
