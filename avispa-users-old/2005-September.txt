Subject: [Avispa-users] Question about AVISPA
Message-ID: <f600cdae3de2d.43188ecb@gmu.edu>

Hi there:

Is there anyone who is using AVISPA? I have two questions about it.

First, when I used the on-line version of AVISPA, and tried to analyze SSL, the IE had no response for about half an hour. I don't know whether it will take so much time to analyze? 

Second, I copied the HLPSL file of NSPK protocol from the D2.1 downloaded from the website and try to analyze it on the web tool, it shows an error: 

AVISPA Web Tool
===============

The HLPSL2IF translator is reporting the following error:

%% Translation of /home/avispa/web-interface-computation/./tempdir/workfileVSeQ3O
%% Syntax error: Line 1, Col 4 (offset 6-8, string "Ace")
%%   Syn.Err(37): missing constant identifier
     

And the first line of my file is : role Ace (A, B: agent,

I just don't know why it is wrong?

Is there someone who can give me advices?

Thanks in advance!


Regards

Jiang

Are you using the expert mode or the basic one? If you are using the
basic one, then I think
you will receive an answer only after all the AVISPA backends have
completed their analysis. 
I would suggest to you to use the expert mode or, even better, to
download the tool so to run
it on your machine.

For sure the role names should be in capital letters. I guess the
version of the NSPK in D2.1
is out-of-date (many things have changed in the HLPSL language since the
delivery of D2.1)
and that is why the HLPSL2IF translator provides an error. I would
suggest to you to have a
look to the on-line HLPSL specifications (there are plenty included the
NSPK):

Subject: [Avispa-users] Grants for prospective PhD students at UNIGE
Message-ID: <200509070736.j877akbq027787@armandobook.mrg.dist.unige.it>

Dear all,

also this year the University of Genova has created a number of grants
for prospective PhD students.  These grants are reserved for foreigners.
The grants are for 3 months and they are seen as a means to identify
common interests between the prospective PhD students and the host
research group.  There is *no* commitment (from either side) to continue
the collaboration into a PhD, even though clearly this is the expected
result.  The candidate should have already a degree that entitles
him/her to undertake a PhD program.  The University of Genova has a long
record of international PhD programs in co-tutoring, e.g. PhD involving
a tutor from UniGe and one from a foreign institution.

The grants are meant to support the developement of a small reasearch
project on one of the following topics:

1. Automatic Analysis of Security Protocols
2. Software Model Checking

The deadline for application is unfortunately very tight (i.e. end of
September), so interested candidates should contact me as soon as
possible.

Best Regards,

alessandro

Hi All,

I have a short question about sets:
I know how to search in a set and how to initialize it. But, how can I update a value in a set?
For example, if I have:

KeyRing : (agent.symmetric_key.text) set

it is initialized in the environment role with:
init KeyRing = {c.k_cs.data_c, i.k_is.data_i}

and in one of the agent roles I would like to update the value of data_c
How can I do this?

thanks in advance

greetings,
Tseno
