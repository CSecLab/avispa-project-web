Message-ID: <BAY110-W3131B1850112124506212E4DF0@phx.gbl>

Hi all,
When executing " avispa-mode.bin " to install xemacs-mode (after exporting all the environment variables according the instruction listed in the file "INSTALL.xemacs"), I get the following message :
 
While compiling toplevel forms in file /home/tarish/programFiles/avispa-1.1/contrib/xemacs-mode/xemacs-mode/avispa.el:  !! File error (("Cannot open load file" "compile"))Cannot open load file: compilexemacs exiting
 
How to fix this problem ?? Thank you all.
 
Yours,
AG. Al-Tamimi

Subject: [Avispa-users] Protocol Animator and binary versions of AVISPA
Message-ID: <4575718D.9060705@irisa.fr>

Dear all AVISPA users,


we are very happy to announce the first release of

        SPAN -- a Security Protocol ANimator for AVISPA


SPAN is designed to help protocol developers in writing HLPSL
specifications. From an HLPSL specification SPAN helps in
interactively buiding  Message Sequence Charts (MSC) of the protocol
execution. Since SPAN implements an active intruder, it can
also be used to interactively find and build attacks over protocols.

SPAN includes a local graphical interface similar to the one of
AVISPA.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
SPAN is distributed under LGPL in source form. We also provide
'complete binary packages' that run on **Linux, Windows, MacOS**
with SPAN and binary versions of AVISPA tools (when available
on a given architecture).

Source and binary packages can be downloaded here:

Please send bugs, comments, improvements to genet@irisa.fr

Best regards,

Thomas
