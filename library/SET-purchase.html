<BR><DT><B>PROTOCOL:</B> <DD> SET Purchase Request, and Payment Authorization<BR>
<BR><DT><B>VARIANT:</B> <DD> Original<BR>
<BR><DT><B>PURPOSE:</B> <DD> <BR>
 The Secure Electronic Transactions (SET) Protocol Suite is designed
 to allow for a secure e-commerce. The key feature is to hide the
 customer's credit card details from the merchant, and the
 customer's purchase details from the bank. Rather, by the
 construction of the protocol, both merchant and bank see only
 what they need to see in order to complete the transaction. 
 Following&nbsp;[BMP:SET:Purchase:TR] we focus here
 on the main part of the protocol, purchase request and payment
 authorization, leaving out the initial registration protocols and 
 assuming already registered participants. Note that we do allow
 dishonest participants.

 The protocol involves three parties: Cardholder <TT>C</TT>, Merchant
 <TT>M</TT>, and Payment Gateway <TT>P</TT>. The cryptographic
 constructions of this protocol are quite complex and for
 readability we thus use the following macros:
 <UL>
 <LI> <TT>Sign_A(Msg)=Msg.{h(Msg)}_inv(SignK(A))</TT>
 <LI> <TT>Encrypt_B(Msg1,K,Msg2)={Msg2}_K.{Msg1.K}EncK(B)</TT>. Note
   that we explicitly give a symmetric key that is used in the
   encryption and that is transmitted in a digital envelope together
   with <TT>Msg1</TT> that is most precious.
 <LI> <TT>SignCert(M)={A.SignK(A)}_inv(SignK(CA))</TT>
 <LI> <TT>EncCert(A)={A.EncK(A)}_inv(SignK(CA))</TT>
 <LI> <TT>DualSig_A(M1,M2) = Sign_A(h(M1).h(M2))</TT>
 </UL>
 Further, for the communicated data, we use the following
 abbreviations (in accordance with the business specification of SET
 and the model of [BMP:SET:Purchase:TR]):
 <UL>
 <LI> <TT>P_Init_Req=LID_M.Chall_C</TT><BR> The purchase initiate request, which
 consists of an identifier and a challenge chosen by the cardholder,
 both modelled as nonces;
 <LI> <TT>P_Init_Resp=LID_M.Chall_C.XID.Chall_M</TT><BR>  
   The response to an initiate request, containing an identifier and
   a challenge from the merchant, modelled as nonces.
 <LI> <TT>AI</TT><BR>  Account Information, the details of the credit
   card of the cardholder. This is the most precious secret of the protocol.
 <LI> <TT>OI=XID.Chall_C.h(OrderDesc.PurchAmt).Chall_M</TT> <BR> 
   Order Information, which contains a hash-value of the
   order description and the purchase amount. These
   data are negotiated out-of-band before the protocol and both cardholder and
   merchant initially share this information.
 <LI> <TT>PI=LID_M.XID.h(OrderDesc.PurchAmt).PurchAmt.M.h(XID.AI)</TT> <BR> 
   Payment Information, containing a hash of the account information
 <LI>
   <TT>AuthReq=LID_M.XID.h(OI).h(OrderDesc.PurchAmt).DualSign_C(PI,OI)</TT>
 <LI> <TT>Auth_Res=LID_M.XID.PurchAmt</TT> 
 <LI> <TT>Purch_Res=LID_M.XID.Chall_C.h(PurchAmt)</TT>
 </UL>
 Purchase Request Protocol:
<PRE>
 % Purchase Initiate Request
 1. C->M: P_Init_Req
 % Purchase Initiate Response
 2. M->C: Sign_M(P_Init_Resp).SignCert(M).EncCert(P)
 % Purchase Request
 3. C->M: OI.DualSig_C(OI,PI).
           Encrypt_P(AI,K1,DualSig_C(OI,PI).PI).
           SignCert(C)
 % Purchase Response
 4. M->C: Sign_M(Purch_Res).SignCert(M)
 </PRE>
 Payment Authorization Protocol:
 <PRE>
 % Payment Authorization Request
 1. M->P: Encrypt_P(_,K2,Sign_M(AuthReq)).
           Encrypt_P(AI,K1,DualSig_C(OI,PI).PI).
          SignCert(C).SignCert(M).EncCert(M)
 % Payment Authorization Response
 2. P->M: Encrypt_M(K3,Sign_P(Auth_Res)).
          Encrypt_P(AI,K4,Sign_P(Cap_Token)).
          SignCert(P)
 </PRE>
 Following [BMP:SET:Purchase:TR], we 
 simplify this into one protocol, omitting certificates (we 
 assume that all agents initially have each other's public-keys) 
 and remove the sub-message that in the payment authorization
 response step which the payment gateway encrypts to itself:
<PRE>
 % Purchase Initiate Request
 1. C->M: P_Init_Req
 % Purchase Initiate Response
 2. M->C: Sign_M(P_Init_Resp)
 % Purchase Request
 3. C->M: OI.DualSig_C(OI,PI).
           Encrypt_P(AI,K1,DualSig_C(OI,PI).PI)
 % Payment Authorization Request
 4. M->P: Encrypt_P(_,K2,Sign_M(AuthReq)).
           Encrypt_P(AI,K1,DualSig_C(OI,PI).PI)
 % Payment Authorization Response
 5. P->M: Encrypt_M(K3,SignK_P(Auth_Res))
 % Purchase Response
 6. M->C: Sign_M(Purch_Res)
 </PRE>
 We consider the following goals: the parties shall authenticate
 each other on (the hash of) the order and payment information. 
 Moreover, the order information shall remain secret between
 cardholder and merchant, and the payment information, in particular
 the credit card details, shall remain
 secret between cardholder and payment gateway.
&nbsp;<BR><BR><DT><B>LIMITATIONS:</B> <DD> <BR>
 We have abstracted from the following details:
 <UL>
 <LI> The shopping process itself, i.e. selection of goods and 
   computing the price to pay.
 <LI> The registration of the participants.
 <LI> The public-key infrastructure and verification 
  of certificates (assuming everybody already has each other's public
  key). 
 <LI> Omitting a special PAN and PANSecret (assuming AI data is
   sufficient for payment gateway).
 </UL>
&nbsp;<BR><BR><DT><B>PROBLEMS:</B> <DD> 4<BR>
<UL>
<LI> strong authentication on <TT>deal</TT>
<LI> weak authentication on <TT>deal</TT>
<LI>secrecy of <TT>order</TT>
<LI>secrecy of <TT>payment</TT>
</UL>
&nbsp;<BR><BR><DT><B>ATTACKS:</B> <DD> <BR>
 The first attack is that a dishonest payment gateway <TT>p</TT>
 can forward a payment authorization request to any other payment gateway <TT>p'</TT>. 
 In a nutshell, the attack trace has the form
 <PRE>
  ... 
  m     -> p:  Encrypt_p (_,K2,Sign_M(AuthReq)).
               Encrypt_p (AI,K1,DualSig_C(OI,PI).PI)
  p(m)  -> p': Encrypt_p'(_,K2,Sign_M(AuthReq)).
               Encrypt_p'(AI,K1,DualSig_C(OI,PI).PI)
  ...
  </PRE>
 This is due to the fact that the part of the message signed by the cardholder
 (as well as the one signed by the merchant) does not contain the name
 of the desired payment gateway.  Rather, the payment gateway 
 is only determined by the public-key encryption for the
 desired gateway. Though only  a dishonest payment
 gateway can ``forward'' the payment requests, this may lead to the
 situation that two payment gateways charge the account of the
 cardholder and both posses messages that seem to prove that the
 cardholder authorized the transaction. The vulnerability is
 limited by the fact that the payment gateway actually chosen by the
 cardholder must be dishonest in the first place. In our opinion, one
 should definitely include the name of the payment gateway also in the
 dual signature to prevent this situation. 
<P>
 We also found a second, albeit quite artificial, attack. 
 For the simplicity of the presentation, we do not display here the complete
 attack trace. Let <TT>c</TT> be an honest cardholder, <TT>m</TT> and <TT>m'</TT> be an
 honest and a dishonest merchant, and <TT>p</TT> and <TT>p'</TT> be an honest and a
 dishonest payment gateway. (All dishonest parties cooperate and are
 thus merged into one intruder.) Consider a session between <TT>c</TT>, <TT>m</TT>
 and <TT>p'</TT>, and a session between <TT>c</TT>, <TT>m'</TT>, and <TT>p</TT>, which all run
 according to the protocol. Let <TT>lid</TT>, <TT>xid</TT>, <TT>orderdesc</TT>, <TT>purchamt</TT>
 be the data of the session between <TT>c</TT>, <TT>m'</TT>, and <TT>p</TT>. Let finally
 <TT>ai</TT> be the account information of <TT>c</TT>. Then the intruder (i.e. <TT>m'</TT> and
 <TT>p'</TT> together) can construct the message
 <PRE>
    lid.xid.h(orderdesc.purchamt).purchamt.m'.h(xid.ai_c)
 </PRE>
 which is the payment information that only the honest participants <TT>c</TT>
 and <TT>p</TT> are supposed to see.  It is thus possible that the secrecy of the
 payment information between an honest cardholder and an honest payment
 gateway is violated, if a dishonest merchant and a dishonest
 payment gateway cooperate.  
 However, the relevance of this attack is questionable. It is standard
 to check protocols under the assumption of dishonest players, and it
 is clear that in such sessions secrecy guarantees, for instance, are void (as
 the intruder knows the secrets). The question is rather whether such
 a session can also compromise the security goals of other sessions (as
 it is the case for instance in the well-known attack against the
 Needham-Schroeder Public Key Protocol). For the SET protocol, however,
 it is clear that, once an
 honest cardholder runs a session with a dishonest payment gateway,
 the account-information of the cardholder is compromised in <I>all</I>
 sessions; it is thus not surprizing that the payment information from
 a session with an honest payment gateway can also be
 reconstructed in such a case. Note that this attack is not possible
 without a dishonest 
 merchant, i.e. even though a dishonest payment gateway knows the
 account details, it cannot obtain order information of sessions
 with an honest merchant. 
<P>
&nbsp;<BR><BR><DT><B>NOTES:</B> <DD> <BR>
<P>
 <UL>
 <LI> There is nothing in the messages that ensures freshness for the 
 payment gateway. However it is unreasonable to assume a payment gateway
 would not log the payment requests it has received. So we can assume that
 it won't accept a second time a message with the same identifiers
 <TT>LID_M</TT> and <TT>XID</TT>, and thus check only for weak
 authentication from the gateways point-of-view. 
 <LI> The cardholder cannot be sure, upon receiving the final purchase
 response message from the merchant, that the payment gateway has
 actually seen the transaction. This is not very surprizing as this
 message can be sent by the merchant without first contacting the
 payment gateway (the merchant then looses the guarantee that
 he will receive the money).
