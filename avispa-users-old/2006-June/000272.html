<PRE>Hi there,


I have a model which happens to take quite a long time for an attack to 
be found, using CL-AtSe. I had hoped that it would be faster if I split 
the transitions into smaller steps, thus constraining the values 
allowed more.


For example, I changed the following command from:

(Apologies for the unhelpful variable names)

step1.
   Rcv({A'}_xor(B',C').C'.{B'}_xor(x,y))
     =|&gt; Snd({A'}_xor(x,C'))

to:

step1a. State = 0 /\ Rcv({B'}_xor(x,y))
          =|&gt; State' := 1

step1b. State = 1 /\ Rcv({A'}_xor(B,C'))
          =|&gt; State' := 2

step1c. State = 2 /\ Rcv(C)
          =|&gt; State' := 0 /\ Snd({A}_xor(x,C))


I hoped that because the initial Rcv was more tightly constrained, and 
later values depended on earlier ones, that some of the search space 
may be cut off.

However, there is a problem - CL-AtSe no longer finds a particular attack.


The problem appears to be in step1c where the intruder has to know the 
value of C. It looks like step1b is not being tried with all possible 
values, thus C is not able to be matched in step1c.

Priming this final C causes the attack to be found (although the 
transition becomes semantically wrong).

There are many possibilities for C', but only one or two are actually 
known by the intruder (in the attack, B is an xor of other terms, not 
all of which the intruder knows). I run the model with the -notype 
option, so it is not caused by CL-AtSe being unable to xor non-message 
types.

I wanted to ask if anyone had any ideas as to what the root of the problem is?

Also, I would like to know if this change is likely to have any effect 
on the search space, and run time, of CL-AtSe, since if it does not 
then I can safely ignore the problem.


thanks in advance,

Gavin Keighren
