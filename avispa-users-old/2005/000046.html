<PRE>Hi,

I've been an AVISPA user since October 2005 and I have a small request 
to ask of members of this mailing list. It is not related to AVISPA 
itself, but rather my own research in the field of security protocols 
analysis. I'm developing a framework of tools and techniques with a 
purpose of supporting users wanting to utilize formal methods for 
security protocols analysis. The goal of the framework is to bring 
formal methods closer to practitioners, i.e. software engineers and 
designers. My own experience so far has been mainly with the 
CSP/FDR/Casper approach and, not surprisingly, AVISPA.

Right now the framework is pretty much done, at least from the 
methodology standpoint (tool support is another story). Right now I'm 
preparing a usability study of the techniques I've prepared. I'd like to 
measure the usability characteristics of the framework such as 
relevance, usefulness, ease-of-use etc. using an approach derived from 
software quality management (I have a strong background in software 
engineering myself). For this purpose, I need an more-or-less 
independently derived set of requirements and evaluation criteria.

And that is where you come in. I have prepared a small web-based survey 
which will allow me to recognize the expectations of users of a 
framework such as mine. Because the AVISPA community consists of 
individuals knowledgeable in the area and experienced with the 
technology, I would very much like to ask you to complete my survey. It 
consists mainly of &quot;closed&quot; multiple-choice questions and should not 
take you more than 10 to 15 minutes.

The URL adrress for my survey is: <A HREF="http://kio.pg.gda.pl/iag/survey/">http://kio.pg.gda.pl/iag/survey/</A>

The survey form is processed by a free Reponse-o-Matic service. It's as 
anonymous as I could manage on a short notice: you don't have to provide 
or use your email address, no IPs are logged etc.

Again, your help would be greatly appreciated.

Best regards,
--
