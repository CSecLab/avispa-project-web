Next Steps in Signaling

<P>
End-to-end Quality of Service (QoS) is needed for voice
over IP and many other applications using the global
Internet.  The current signalling solution is RSVP,
defined in [<A HREF="node41_ct.html#RFC2205" TARGET="contents">40</A>].  The security extensions
of [<A HREF="node41_ct.html#RFC3182" TARGET="contents">209</A>,<A HREF="node41_ct.html#RFC2747" TARGET="contents">26</A>,<A HREF="node41_ct.html#RFC2207" TARGET="contents">36</A>]
define the
Protocol <B>RSVP-sec (<SPAN CLASS="arabic">7</SPAN>)</B>.
For a discussion of the security properties of the
protocol, see also [<A HREF="node41_ct.html#nsis-rsvp-sec-properties" TARGET="contents">188</A>].

<P>
<EM>Protocol RSVP-sec should provide Authentication&nbsp;
<BR>[1](G1,
<BR>[1]2).</EM>

<P>
For end-to-end QoS, needed in many applications, it is
likely that several administrative domains are
traversed, but this may be problematic if the domains
deploy different QoS solutions.  Thus a protocol must
signal the QoS parameters from one domain to the other.
The NSIS WG is currently discussing the framework for a
new simple protocol for signaling QoS, which would
allow users to obtain QoS-aware services irrespective
of the underlying mechanisms used.  Compatibility with
authentication and authorization mechanisms is also
considered.

<P>
NSIS has not yet defined a protocol that will be
interesting for our purposes. Perhaps the WG will not
define a specific protocol. Nevertheless, Siemens is
strongly involved in the activities of the group and
may provide to AVISPA a version of Protocol <B>NSIS-acc (<SPAN CLASS="arabic">8</SPAN>)</B>, a next generation QoS signalling protocol that includes
accounting and that could be proposed eventually at the
IETF or elsewhere.  In AVISPA, we intend to model and
verify such a protocol.

<P>
The property that this protocol has to possess is
easily posed as a temporal logic property: the user
should not pay if he obtains no service, or in other
words: if he pays, then he has obtained the service.

<P>
<EM>Protocol NSIS-acc should provide Authentication, Secrecy, Identity Protection (Eavesdropper and Peer) and a property that may be expressed as a Temporal Formula&nbsp;
<BR>[1](G1,
<BR>[1]2,
<BR>[1]12-14,
<BR>[1]20).</EM>
