<P>
The goal of this deliverable is to select candidate
protocols and to present their security properties
(goals), (on average, more than 4 properties per
protocol).  We assess the coverage and relevance of the
resulting problem set, with comments of IETF
representatives being taken into account.

<P>
Our list of candidate protocols includes 33
groups, 79 protocols and 384
security problems.

<P>
This list of candidate protocols is the basis for the
success criteria for the project, namely,

<UL>
<LI>to specify at least 80 security problems from
     20 groups,
</LI>
<LI>for at least 60 of these 80 problems, including at least one
       problem from each of the first seven groups (in the AVISPA
       proposal called the ``Main Protocols''), to verify that the
       protocol satisfies the desired security property
(at least in a certain configuration, with a
       bounded number of sessions) or to find a
       counterexample demonstrating that the property
       is violated, and
</LI>
<LI>to perform the verification of each problem in
    less than 1 hour of CPU time.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Not all IETF protocols are equally important for the
proper operation of the Internet or for the secure
support of applications; nor are all protocols suitable
for the kind of formal verification that we plan to
perform, either because their strength or weakness
depends on the particulars of the cryptographic
algorithms used, on policy-based operation, or on
their performance.  Some protocols are just
``containers'' that pass further unspecified
authentication information. Some protocols have so many
different layers, exceptions, configurations, and
message exchanges that a reasonable abstraction and
formalization is beyond the scope of our proposal.

<P>
Within these constraints, the purpose of this
deliverable is to evaluate the protocols and select the
candiate problems for formal specification.  They are
given by both the protocol description and a set of
security properties the protocol should satisfy. In
general, a protocol is designed to achieve a multitude
of security goals, e.g. secrecy of session key <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN>,
or authentication of a peer in role <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>A</I></SPAN> with strong
agreement on nonce <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN>. We therefore introduce the
notion of a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">security problem</SPAN>, which is given by
a protocol paired with a security property.

<P>
Taking into account that in many cases the desired
security properties are not explicitly stated in IETF
documents, work on this deliverable included both
thorough analysis of the protocols and the initiation
of a discussion process with IETF representatives, with
the selection being based on their comments on coverage
and relevance to problem proposals by AVISPA.

<P>
Our list of 33 groups and 79
protocols covers most of the recent and ongoing IETF
activities on security and security-sensitive
applications.  In specifying the IETF protocols and
their associated problems, we will need to perform a
certain amount of abstraction and simplification. Some
of this <EM>may</EM> be necessary to deal with the
limitations of our tools (e.g., with respect to the
number of concurrent sessions, or agents, or on some
data types), and some because certain features of the
protocol (such as the cipher suites used, techniques
for negotiating them, policy issues, or strength
against some denial of service attacks) will be outside
the scope of our analysis.  Besides this, most of the
IETF protocols are not written in a language that is
readily translatable to a formal specification.  We
expect that in many cases there will be a need to
discuss the protocols with their developers in order to
properly interpret the intended meaning of the
(proposed) standards. These discussions are conducted
in continuation of the process initiated in this
deliverable.
