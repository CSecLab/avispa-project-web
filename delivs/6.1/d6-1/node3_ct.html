Properties (Goals)
</H1>

<P>
The usual properties referred to as security properties
(or security goals) in IETF documents are the following
(see
[<A HREF="node41_ct.html#RFC3552" TARGET="contents">160</A>,,<A HREF="node41_ct.html#jwalker-eap-archie" TARGET="contents">201</A>,<A HREF="node41_ct.html#eap-keying" TARGET="contents">3</A>],
and also
[<A HREF="node41_ct.html#7812-2:1993" TARGET="contents">87</A>,<A HREF="node41_ct.html#handbook-of-crypto" TARGET="contents">118</A>]).

<P>

<OL>
<LI><B>Authentication (unicast)</B>: Verifying an
   identity (distinguishing identifier) claimed by or
   for a system entity, which may be a peer in a
   communication or the source of some data. This
   assured Identity may be well known (a real name,
   telephone number, mailing address, phone number,
   social security number, IP- or email address) or it
   can be an unlinkable identifier (like a
   pseudonym). The verification is achieved presenting
   authentication information (credentials) that
   corroborates the binding between the entity and the
   identifier. Authentication is usually divided into
   entity and message (or data) authentication.  The
   main difference between the two is that message
   authentication provides no timeliness guarantee (the
   authenticated message may be old), while entity
   authentication implies actual communication with an
   associated verifier during execution of the current
   run of the protocol.  Authentication is usually
   unilateral (``Alice authenticates Bob'').
   <EM>Mutual Authentication</EM> refers to
   Authentication in both directions.
   
<OL>
<LI><B>(G<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>)</B> <B>Entity
        authentication (Peer Entity Authentication)</B>:

<P>
Assuring one party, through presentation of
        evidence and/or credentials of the identity of
        a second party involved in a protocol, and that
        the second has actually participated during
        execution of the current run of the protocol.
        Usually this is done by presenting a piece of
        data that could only have been generated by the
        second party in question (as a response to a
        challenge, for instance).  Thus, usually entity
        authentication implies that some data can be
        unequivocally traced back to a certain entity,
        which implies Data Origin Authentication.
</LI>
<LI><B>(G<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN>)</B> <B>Message authentication (Data
        Origin Authentication)</B>: The protocol must
        provide means to ensure confidence that a
        received message or piece of data has been
        created by a certain party at some (typically
        unspecified) time in the past, and that this
        data has not been corrupted or tampered with,
        but without giving uniqueness or timeliness
        guarantees. The confidence that data has been
        created by a certain party, but without the
        assurance that it has not been modified, is of
        no interest for us.  Thus Message
        authentication implies integrity.  See also
        [<A HREF="node41_ct.html#RFC2828" TARGET="contents">174</A>] ``Relationship between data
        integrity service and authentication
        services''.  Only very few Internet protocols
        offer Data Origin Authentication without
        providing Entity Authentication (IPsec AH or
        PKI Signatures would be examples, both
        relatively trivial to verify).  In our list of
        candidate protocols for AVISPA we have no
        protocol in this category.
</LI>
<LI><B>(G<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN>)</B> <B>Replay Protection</B>: Some IETF
        documents define Replay Protection as ``The
        protocol must provide means to ensure
        confidence that a received message has not been
        recorded and played back by an adversary''. As
        such, this property is not verifiable. We
        define it rather as: Assuring one party that an
        authenticated message is not old.  Depending on
        the context, this could have different
        meanings:
        
<UL>
<LI>that the message was generated during
             this session, or
</LI>
<LI>that the message was generated during
             a known recent time window, or
</LI>
<LI>that the message has not been
              accepted before.
        
</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
</LI>
<LI><B>Authentication in Multicast or via a
   Subscribe / Notify Service</B>: These are the
   authentication requirements for groups with a single
   source and a very large number of potential
   recipients (multicast), or a source and a service
   which posts the information to subscribed (and
   authorized) users.  The basic requirements for the
   solution are:
   
<OL>
<LI><B>(G<SPAN CLASS="arabic">4</SPAN>)</B> <B>Implicit Destination Authentication</B>
       The protocol must provide means to ensure that a
       sent message is only readable by entities that
       the sender allows.  That is, only legitimate
       authorized members will have access to the
       current information, multicast message or group
       communication. This includes groups with highly
       dynamic membership.
</LI>
<LI><B>(G<SPAN CLASS="arabic">5</SPAN>)</B> <B>Source Authentication</B> Legitimate group
       members will be able to authenticate the source
       and contents of the information or group
       communication. This includes cases where group
       members do not trust each other.
   
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
</LI>
<LI><B>Authorization (by a Trusted Third Party)</B>:
       In some protocols, a Trusted Third Party <B>T3P</B>
       introduces one principal <B>B</B> to another
       principal <B>A</B> and <B>A</B> is assured that
       <B>B</B> is ``trusted'' by the <B>T3P</B> and is
       ``authorized'', in the required sense of the
       protocol.  When the protocol is run between <B>       A</B>, <B>B</B> and <B>T3P</B>, then <B>A</B> is
       perhaps not able to use local access control
       lists or other mechanisms to authorize <B>B</B>,
       (because the name of <B>B</B> is unknown to <B>       A</B>, or may even be a pseudonym), but <B>A</B> is
       assured that <B>B</B> is authorized by <B>T3P</B>.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><B>Key Agreement Properties</B>:
   
<OL>
<LI><B>(G<SPAN CLASS="arabic">6</SPAN>)</B> <B>Key authentication</B> is the property
        whereby one party is assured that no other
        party aside from a specifically identified
        second party (and possibly additional
        identified trusted parties) may gain access to
        a particular secret key.
</LI>
<LI><B>(G<SPAN CLASS="arabic">7</SPAN>)</B> <B>Key confirmation (Key Proof of
        Possession)</B>: one party is assured that a second
        (possibly unidentified) party actually has
        possession of a particular secret key (or of
        all keying material needed to calculate it).
</LI>
<LI><B>(G<SPAN CLASS="arabic">8</SPAN>)</B> <B>Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS)</B>: A
        protocol has this property if compromise of
        long-term keys does not compromise past session
        keys.
</LI>
<LI><B>(G<SPAN CLASS="arabic">9</SPAN>)</B> <B>Fresh Key Derivation</B> The protocol uses
        dynamic key management in order to derive fresh
        session keys.
</LI>
<LI><B>(G<SPAN CLASS="arabic">10</SPAN>)</B> <B>Secure capabilities negotiation
        (Resistance against Downgrading and Negotiation
        Attacks)</B>.  When a key agreement
        protocol also discovers the cryptographic
        capabilities and preferences of the peers and
        negotiates the security parameters (such as
        security association identifiers, key strength,
        and ciphersuites), it is important to ensure
        that the announced capabilities and negotiated
        parameters have not been forged by an attacker.
   
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
</LI>
<LI><B>(G<SPAN CLASS="arabic">11</SPAN>)</B> <B>Confidentiality (Secrecy)</B>: The
   property that a particular data item or information
   (usually sent or received as part of the content of
   a ``secured'' message, or else constructed on the
   basis of exchanged data) is not made available or
   disclosed to unauthorized individuals, entities, or
   processes, and remains unknown to the intruder.  We
   choose the convention that the secrecy of a session
   key generated during a key agreement is not
   considered here but in Goal ``Key authentication''
   above.  Also the secrecy of a long-term key used
   within a protocol is not part considered as a
   secrecy goal of the protocol.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><B>Anonymity</B> Many protocols do not provide
  anonymity, since the peer has to know with whom he is
  speaking in order to determine which cryptographic
  key to use. But some protocols do hide the Identities:
   
<OL>
<LI><B>(G<SPAN CLASS="arabic">12</SPAN>)</B> <B>Identity Protection against
       Eavesdroppers</B>: An attacker (eavesdropper)
       should not be able to link the communication
       exchanged by one party to the real identity of
       the party.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><B>(G<SPAN CLASS="arabic">13</SPAN>)</B> <B>Identity Protection against Peer</B>:
       The peer in a communication should not be able to link
       the communication exchanged by one party to the
       real identity of the party, but rather to an
       unlinked pseudonym or private identifier.
   
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
</LI>
<LI><B>(G<SPAN CLASS="arabic">14</SPAN>)</B> <B>(Limited) Denial-of-Service (DoS)
   Resistance</B>: It is difficult to verify DoS
   Resistance. One reason is that a protocol may be
   subject to DoS attacks for many different reasons,
   the most common being that it consumes too many
   resources (memory, computational power), before the
   peer authenticates itself.  But there are many other
   reasons: among others, protocols may be vulnerable
   to
   
<OL>
<LI>DoS on memory allocation,
</LI>
<LI>DoS on computational power, and
</LI>
<LI>Bombing Attacks on third parties. 
        (This is inducing one or several hosts to send
        large amounts of packets to a victim).
   
</LI>
</OL>
   [<A HREF="node41_ct.html#DoS-Meadows" TARGET="contents">117</A>] shows how some
   principles that have already been used to make
   protocols more resistant to denial of service can be
   formalized.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><B>(G<SPAN CLASS="arabic">15</SPAN>)</B> <B>Sender Invariance</B>: A party is
   assured that the source of the communication has
   remained the same as the one that started the
   communication, although the actual identity of the
   source is not important to the recipient.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><B>Non-repudiation</B> Prevention of a user
   wrongly denying having performed an action, in
   particular:
   
<OL>
<LI><B>(G<SPAN CLASS="arabic">16</SPAN>)</B> <B>``Accountability''</B>: The property of a
       system (including all of its system resources)
       that ensures that the actions of a system entity
       may be traced uniquely to that entity, which can
       be held responsible for its actions.
</LI>
<LI><B>(G<SPAN CLASS="arabic">17</SPAN>)</B> <B>Proof of Origin</B> Undeniable evidence of
       having sent a message.
</LI>
<LI><B>(G<SPAN CLASS="arabic">18</SPAN>)</B> <B>Proof of Delivery</B> Undeniable evidence
       of having received a message.
   
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
</LI>
<LI><B>(G<SPAN CLASS="arabic">19</SPAN>)</B> <B>Safety Temporal Property</B>: Using two
      temporal-logic operators (for linear temporal
      logic), the ``Always'' and the ``Sometime in the
      Past'' operators, it is possible to formalize
      properties of the form: in any reachable state
      that has a property <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>p</I></SPAN>, there was in the past a
      state with property <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>q</I></SPAN>.  Formulaically: <!-- MATH
 $\Box (p
\Rightarrow \overline{\Diamond} q)$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG

Properties of this kind, which are not
      directly seen as standard security properties,
      are: if a user has to pay for a service, then he
      must have obtained the service, or if a host
      receives a large amount of packets in streaming
      mode, then he must have asked for them.  Notice
      also that the security properties discussed above
      are all expressible in the form of a Safety
      Temporal Property.
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
In the last few months, a new set of properties have
been discussed in some IETF drafts (in particular, at
the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) Working
Group, see [<A HREF="node41_ct.html#eap-rfc2284bis" TARGET="contents">37</A>]) and
Section&nbsp;
<BR>[1]<A HREF="node17_ct.html#EAP">4.13</A>).  The properties are:

<P>

<UL>
<LI><B>Session Formation</B> A protocol
         accomplishes session formation by binding each
         particular protocol instance with a unique
         value, the generalized session ID, which is
         usually a distinct tuple of nonces and
         identifiers. This generalized session ID
         distinguishes this session from any other
         sessions.  After an initial part of the
         protocol, all mesages contain the generalized
         session Identifier (not necessarily in
         cleartext).
</LI>
<LI><B>Consistent View</B>
         When an instance of protocol succeeds, all
         parties in the run share the same
         view of the participants in the protocol
         instance and their respective roles, and of
         the protocol state.
</LI>
<LI><B>Key naming</B> In order to ensure against
         confusion between the appropriate keying
         material to be used in a given secure
         association protocol exchange, the protocol
         must include explicit key names and context
         appropriate for informing the authenticator
         how the keying material is to be used. If the
         protocol provides key proof of possession, the
         protocol must explicitly name the keys used
         during the the proof of possession exchange,
         so as to prevent confusion when more than one
         set of keying material could potentially be
         used as the basis for the exchange.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
We are optimistic that we will
be able to formalize and verify these properties in
AVISPA, but it is still not fully clear how to do it.

<P>
Other properties that are sometimes discussed as
relevant security properties at the IETF (see in
particular [<A HREF="node41_ct.html#eap-rfc2284bis" TARGET="contents">37</A>]) include:

<P>

<UL>
<LI><B>Cryptographic Separation of Keys</B>
</LI>
<LI><B>Cipher suite negotiation</B>
</LI>
<LI><B>Dictionary Attack Resistance</B>
</LI>
<LI><B>Cryptographic Binding</B>
</LI>
<LI><B>Support for fast reconnect</B>
</LI>
<LI><B>Acknowledged success and failure indications</B>
</LI>
<LI><B>Session independence</B>
</LI>
<LI><B>Man-in-the-Middle Attack Resistance</B>
</LI>
<LI><B>Peer Liveness</B>
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
The last two are not really new security properties,
they relate directly to the Authentication properties
discussed above.

<P>
The first seven properties are not model-checking
properties, but are verified by other methods, outside
of the scope of AVISPA.
