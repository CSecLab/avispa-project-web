<PRE>Hi Kostas,

I would be uncomfortable if we started referring to HLPSL as a  
programming language, I must say.  It's really a modelling language  
in the canonical sense.  The semantics is based on (and is very close  
to) the Temporal Logic of Actions, so it's closer to a logic.  To me,  
a logic is not a programming language (yes, yes, Prolog, ok).

Also, note that there is no standard definition of a translation from  
HLPSL to machine code, which is certainly an essential part of a  
programming language.  I agree with you that HLPSL specifications  
induce state machines which are, in turn, explored within the  
backends.  However, I don't think this is much different from an MP3  
file which induces an audio player to execute in a certain way in  
order to play the song, but that doesn't mean that the machine is  
&quot;executing&quot; the MP3 file.  I admit that this is a very construed  
example, but I hope what I mean is clear.

Finally, you could make a list of things that HLPSL does not support  
that any (useful) programming language would need, from I/O to  
arithmetic to what-have-you.

So my vote is that HLPSL is a modelling language but not a  
programming language.

Cheers,
Paul.
