<PRE>Hello Bhavai,

This is kind of a difficult question, because it depends so strongly  
on your model.

The simple answer is yes, I can make you a model which comes out as  
SAFE even though there is a known attack on the protocol.  All I have  
to do is take the model of the NSPK protocol and analyze it using  
only one session, between A and B.  Since the known attack requires  
an additional session between A and I, a known attack in the  
literature will not be found.  But this is my fault as the modeler,  
and not the fault of the AVISPA Tool or methodology.

Similarly, it is easy to construct a (bad) model in which attacks are  
found that are not actually relevant.  The easiest way to do this is  
to take an authentication protocol, and insert the &quot;request&quot; facts  
too early, before the authentication has really succeeded.  You'll  
find a ton of attacks, and they will be irrelevant, but again this is  
the fault of the modeler and not of the tool.

Or you could construct models of protocols for which attacks are  
known, but they are based on aspects of the environment that AVISPA  
does not capture: timing attacks are a good example.

So the answer is, within the constraints of valid HLPSL models, the  
AVISPA tool is sound and complete.  All attacks that are found are  
really attacks on the model (even if the model is constructed badly),  
and no attacks on the specified analysis scenario are missed.  But  
the critical point is that we are talking about models here.

Hope this helps,
Paul.
