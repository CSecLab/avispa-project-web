<PRE>Hi,

thanks for your response. Here are my views on what you have said:


&gt;<i> I think there's a slightly different interpretation between the step1
</I>&gt;<i> transitions and the subtransitions, especially in step1b.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> For example, I changed the following command from:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (Apologies for the unhelpful variable names)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> step1.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    Rcv({A'}_xor(B',C').C'.{B'}_xor(x,y))
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      =|&gt; Snd({A'}_xor(x,C'))
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> step1b. State = 1 /\ Rcv({A'}_xor(B,C'))
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>           =|&gt; State' := 2
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you split the messages like that, the agent who receives
</I>&gt;<i> {A'}_xor(B,C') must match two values: A' and C'. In the step1
</I>&gt;<i> transition, however, the agent can gather the value of A' because it 
</I>&gt;<i> can
</I>&gt;<i> find, firstly, the value of B', and then the value of C' and, finally,
</I>&gt;<i> the value of A'.
</I>
I should have mentioned that the agent who is receiving the information 
cannot be the intruder, and it is in fact the intruder who is sending 
the messages. He also knows information of the form {A'}_xor(B',C'), 
C', and {B'}_xor(x,y).

As such, I was under the impression that the unification algorithm 
would be able to match {A'}_xor(B,C') in step 1b with a particular 
piece of information known to the intruder, given the fixed value of B. 
That is, it would be the same as replacing B by a known constant. 
Although the intruder cannot work out directly what the message should 
be, he has the required information to provide a correct message, and 
thus I thought the unification algorithm would mean that the intruder 
would in fact provide the correct message.


&gt;<i> I wonder if an agent can postpone a decryption of a message until it 
</I>&gt;<i> has
</I>&gt;<i> all the values to construct the necessary key.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What about uniting step1b and step1c together? So, the subtransition
</I>&gt;<i> step1b would be something like this:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> step1b. State = 1 /\ Rcv({A'}_xor(B,C').C')
</I>&gt;<i>           =|&gt; State' := 0 /\ Snd({A'}_xor(x,C'))
</I>
I tried this as well, but it too does not work.


&gt;<i> A curious question, is it intentional that you put State' := 0?
</I>
Yes, the aim is that the agent is initially in state 0, then has to 
carry out the steps in order, returning to state 0 after the final one 
has been carried out.



thanks for your help,

Gavin
