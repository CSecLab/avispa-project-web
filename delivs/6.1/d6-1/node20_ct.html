Password-Authenticated Key Exchange

<P>
A whole range of protocols rather robust against
dictionary attacks has appeared.  The list includes
Protocol <B>EKE (<SPAN CLASS="arabic">31</SPAN>)</B>, Encrypted Key Exchange,
defined in [<A HREF="node41_ct.html#EKE" TARGET="contents">34</A>],
Protocol <B>EKE2 (<SPAN CLASS="arabic">32</SPAN>)</B>, a second Encrypted Key Exchange,
defined in  [<A HREF="node41_ct.html#EKE2" TARGET="contents">30</A>],
Protocol <B>SPEKE (<SPAN CLASS="arabic">33</SPAN>)</B>, defined in [<A HREF="node41_ct.html#SPEKE" TARGET="contents">91</A>],
and
Augmented-EKE, Protocol <B>A-EKE (<SPAN CLASS="arabic">34</SPAN>)</B>, which has been described in [<A HREF="node41_ct.html#A-EKE" TARGET="contents">35</A>]
and further discussed in [<A HREF="node41_ct.html#Refin-EKE" TARGET="contents">176</A>].

<P>
Protocol <B>SRP (<SPAN CLASS="arabic">35</SPAN>)</B>, the SRP Authentication and Key Exchange
System, is defined in [<A HREF="node41_ct.html#RFC2945" TARGET="contents">208</A>].

<P>
<EM>Each of these protocols,
Protocol EKE,
Protocol EKE2,
Protocol SPEKE,
Protocol A-EKE, and
Protocol SRP should provide Authentication and Secrecy&nbsp;
<BR>[1](G1,
<BR>[1]2,
<BR>[1]12).</EM>
(Depending on the version they also provide Key Agreement).

<P>
Background and motivation for these protocols is as
follows.  To send a password in the clear, or a
static function of it, is obviously insecure: an
attacker can replay this information.  The idea behind
so-called challenge-response techniques is that
challenges are never reused and that the response
depends both on the password and on the challenge. Thus
responses can not be replayed. Nevertheless many
password based challenge-response protocols are
vulnerable to dictionary attacks.  This occurs when
an attacker captures the messages exchanged during a
legitimate run of the protocol and uses that
information to verify a series of guessed passwords
taken from a precompiled dictionary of common
passwords.  This works because users often choose
simple, easy-to-remember passwords, which invariably
are also easy to guess.
