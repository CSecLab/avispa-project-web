BACKGROUND, AIM AND SCOPE
=========================

    Experience over the last twenty years has shown that, even assuming
perfect cryptography, the design of security protocols (or cryptographic
protocols, as they are sometimes called) is highly error-prone and that
conventional validation techniques based on informal arguments and/or
testing are not up to the task.  It is now widely recognized that only
formal analysis can provide the level of assurance required by both the
developers and the users of the protocols.

    Work in this direction initially started in the security community but
recently there has been a tremendous progress thanks to contributions
from different automated reasoning communities, such as model checking,
resolution, planning, rewriting/narrowing, and higher-order theorem
proving. There has been another wave of progress due to
research in applying non-classical logics, such as epistemic and belief
logics, to analyze protocols and their properties. Moreover, a third
stream includes static methods, among which those based on abstract
interpretation, data and control flow analysis, and type systems proved
to be particularly successful. Finally, bisimulations and related
techniques have also been applied successfully.

    Based on this progress, a large number of formal methods and tools
have been developed that have been quite successful in determining
strengths and weaknesses of many protocols, i.e. in proving the
correctness of the protocols or in identifying attacks on them.

   The ARSPA workshop aims to bring together researchers and
practitioners from both the security and the formal methods communities,
from academia and industry, who are working on developing and applying
automated reasoning techniques and tools for the formal specification
and analysis of security protocols.

Contributions are welcomed on the following topics or related ones:

- Automated analysis and verification of security protocols.
- Languages, logics and calculi for the design and specification of
    security protocols.
- Verification methods: accuracy, efficiency.
- Decidability and complexity of cryptographic verification problems.
- Synthesis and composition of security protocols.
- Integration of formal security specification, refinement and
    validation techniques in development methods and tools.

The workshop will provide a forum for all researchers and practitioners
who are interested in this area to share their ideas and report their
results. We thus solicit submissions of papers both on mature work and
on work in progress.

All submissions will be peer-reviewed. Authors of accepted papers must
guarantee that their paper will be presented at the workshop.



AUDIENCE
========

The workshop will be held on Saturday, July 16, 2005, and will be open to
all interested persons.



INVITED TALKS
