Dear AVISPA users,
the AVISPA web interface is again up-and-running!  All these troubles
have been due to
intensive memory swap in the machine running the AVISPA backends (i.e.
OFMC, SATMC,
CL-AtSe, and TA4SP).  To solve this issue we have imposed that a limited
number of AVISPA
backends can be run concurrently. When the message

"Sorry too many backends are running and there are not enough resources
available. Please try later.."

is returned to you means that this limit has been exceeded.  Moreover
each backend process
is limited to run up to 200 MB RAM.  As soon as the backend process
requires more than 200MB,
the process is killed by the Operating System. 

This is the best we can do at the moment.  Notice that the AVISPA web
interface is not meant
to be used for time and memory intensive experiments but just as a demo
for presenting the
tool.  For intensive test we recommend to download the AVISPA package. 

Best regards,
Luca

Dear David,
we apologize for all these troubles.  Unfortunately the machine on which
the
AVISPA web interface runs crashed over the week-end.  I have just rebooted
it, but given the last events this machine is not reliable.  We will have a
meeting today for seeing if possible to setup a new machine soon.

The software of the web-interface is not distributed. It will be soon.

FYI, the AVISPA web interface seems to be having trouble again.
It gives the following error:


AVISPA Web Tool
===============

The HLPSL2IF translator is reporting the following error:

Secure connection to 130.251.7.42 refused.



Is the software to run my own copy of the AVISPA web page interface
available in the AVISPA distribution?  I'm having my undergraduate class
use this in their class project, and I'd be happy to run a separate copy
of the web page on my own machine just for my class if that makes things
any easier.

Thanks.

No problem.  I'm sorry to cause you trouble.

Wonderful!  Thank you very much!  This is a great resource, and I
very much appreciate your help in enabling my students to learn to
use the AVISPA tools.

Thanks again,

Subject: [Avispa-users] Hello and Introduction
Message-ID: <6216396AEBE36247BF62B505A88ADA0A0C222E83@uk-ex002.groupinfra.com>

Hello,

 

How are you?  I am taking the (part time) MSc in Information Security at
Royal Holloway University of London.  I would appreciate any comments or
suggestions that you have regarding my initial ideas as described below.

 

I would like to do my MSc project (to be completed by 8 September 2006)
on mathematical analysis of security protocols.  The BAN logic (Mike
Burrows, Martin Abadi, and Roger Needham) may provide a good starting
point since it was the first and is probably the most famous analytical
method.  However, there are other formal methodologies.  Some suitable
websites that I have found as a result of an initial search are as
follows (although I have not investigated them very deeply at present):

 

*         http://www.avispa-project.org/ (of course)

*         http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/lcp/papers/protocols.html

*         http://www.stcatz.ox.ac.uk/academic_staff_pages/lowe_gavin.htm

*
http://portal.surrey.ac.uk/portal/page?_pageid=798,332537&_dad=portal&_s
chema=PORTAL

*         And many others!!!

 

It would be interesting to see if the newer methods can find known (and
possibly additional) vulnerabilities that have already been found by
utilisation of the traditional methods, but perhaps shorter, faster or
more elegantly.  It may also be interesting to see whether security
protocols that have not yet been formally analysed could be subjected to
modern mathematical analyses.  To find a significant vulnerability in a
relatively new protocol would be an excellent bonus for this MSc
project, although the time constraints may preclude this eventuality.

 

In addition to the MSc in Information Security which is in progress at
present, my formal academic & professional qualifications are as
follows:

 

*         BSc, Grade II(i), Pure Mathematics, University of Kent, 1984.

*         MPhil (by thesis), Mathematical Logic, University of
Nottingham, 1987.

*         BCS ISEB Certificate in Information Security Management
Principles, 2000.

*         Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP),
2004.

*         (plus many other smaller/specialised security courses and
training.)

 

A brief overview of my career and experience is as follows.  In the
Systems Assurance Division of EDS in the early 1990s I was in a team
that developed a Z tool in Lisp on Sun workstations, for CESG.  Then I
moved into projects performing safety critical static source code
analysis using SPADE and MALPAS.  We also developed a proprietary static
code analysis tool written initially in Prolog and then completely
rewritten in SML.  After that I joined the CLEF part of EDS to do an
ITSEC E3 evaluation of a database.  In 1996 I joined the Logica CLEF to
do further ITSEC and Common Criteria evaluations covering operating
systems, databases, firewalls, crypto tools, etc.  From 2000 to 2002 I
worked for Platform 7 Limited (which was bought by Datacard) on smart
card security.  I am currently in the LogicaCMG CLEF at Leatherhead,
doing Common Criteria security evaluations and consultancy.

 

Thanks in advance for your general comments on the above.

 

I look forward to your reply.

 

Bhavin.

   We apologize for multiple copies of this call for papers 
==========================================================================

    Call for Papers / Appel ? soumissions
5th Conference on Security and Network Architectures (SAR 2006)
    Co-located with the
3rd Conference on Security in Information Systems (SSI)
VVF Les Tuquets, Seignosse, France - 6-9 juin 2006
http://csysec.univ-pau.fr/sarssi/
==========================================================================

After the success of the four former SAR conferences, SAR 2006 will take
place in Seignosse, France. SAR 2006 covers a large spectrum of research
on security and network architectures. The purpose of the conference is
to offer to the computer science community - engineers, researchers,
teachers and students - the opportunity to discuss advances in research
and development in network security.

The conference will enable scientists to present the last advances in
the network security domain and to analyze the impact of these emerging
technologies on this domain. Part of the conference is devoted to
tutorials in advanced fields of security in order to encourage
interactions and exchanges between participants.

Papers offering novel research contributions in any aspect of computer
security or electronic privacy are solicited for submission to the 2006
symposium. Papers may represent advances in the theory, design,
implementation, analysis, or empirical evaluation of secure systems,
either for general use or for specific application domains.

This Year: SAR 2006 is open to submissions not only of full-length
papers but also short papers (extended abstracts) describing less mature
work. Submissions can be either in French or English, see the web site
for details.
