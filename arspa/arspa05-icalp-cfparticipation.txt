		     *** CALL FOR PARTICIPATION ***
		     ******************************

A large number of formal methods and tools have been developed that have
been quite successful in determining strengths and weaknesses of many
protocols, i.e. in proving the correctness of the protocols or in
identifying attacks on them.
The ARSPA workshop aims to bring together researchers and practitioners
from both the security and the formal methods communities, from academia
and industry, who are working on developing and applying automated
reasoning techniques and tools for the formal specification and analysis
of security protocols.
