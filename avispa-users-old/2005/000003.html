<PRE>Dear Matthias,

you wrote:
&gt;<i> I have been playing with AVISPA for the past few days. Overall my
</I>&gt;<i> impressions are very positive. It is a great piece of software, the
</I>&gt;<i> installation is painless, the documentation is good and overall I found
</I>&gt;<i> it a lot easier to use than some of the other tools in the same space.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Thank you very much!

&gt;<i> * Non-executable models. As mentioned in the manual &amp; tutorial, and
</I>&gt;<i> evidenced by my own observations, it is very easy to make mistakes that
</I>&gt;<i> result in the model becoming partially un-executable and the model
</I>&gt;<i> checker consequently reporting success. The tutorial suggests using the
</I>&gt;<i> -p option to step through the states. However, that is extremely tedious
</I>&gt;<i> for anything but the most trivial models.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Would it be possible to perform an automated check that all transitions
</I>&gt;<i> in a model are reachable and can fire? That, I think, would catch most
</I>&gt;<i> of the cases of non-executable models. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * Secure channels. Currently, the only type of channel supported by the
</I>&gt;<i> modelling language are Dolev-Yao channels. For modelling complex systems
</I>&gt;<i> I find myself wanting to decompose roles into smaller entities but since
</I>&gt;<i> the insecure D-Y channels are the only form of communication available
</I>&gt;<i> this introduces spurious vulnerabilities.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The same problem arises more generally when trying to model systems
</I>&gt;<i> where parts of the communication are impervious to attack. Would it be
</I>&gt;<i> possible to introduce a secure channel type?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * Web interface. The downloadable distribution of AVISPA does not appear
</I>&gt;<i> to contain the web interface and the trace-&gt;msc converter. Would it be
</I>&gt;<i> possible to make these available?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * Typed vs un-typed. In a number of cases I encountered models where I
</I>&gt;<i> though an attack was possible but AVISPA declared the protocol safe. On
</I>&gt;<i> closer inspection that turned out to be due to types. In one example
</I>&gt;<i> there was a replay attack possible if a text type could be interpreted
</I>&gt;<i> as a symmetric key type. Whether that attack is possible in reality
</I>&gt;<i> depends on the crypto used. Turning off type-checking resulted in the
</I>&gt;<i> attack being found. It's probably worth pointing that out in the
</I>&gt;<i> manual/tutorial.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
The issues you arise in your e-mail are very interesting. We'll save your 
suggestions for the next release of the tool. More precise answers to
your questions will follow..

Best regards,

Jacopo Mantovani
