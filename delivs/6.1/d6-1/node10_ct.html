<P>
Some applications need to acquire geographic location
information about certain resources or entities. These
applications include navigation, emergency services,
management of equipment in the field, and other
location-based services.  The main issues arising from
generating, using, and passing location information
about users are privacy related, see
[<A HREF="node41_ct.html#geopriv-reqs" TARGET="contents">51</A>] and [<A HREF="node41_ct.html#geopriv-threats" TARGET="contents">65</A>]. 
<P>
Geopriv has not yet defined (and perhaps will
not define) a protocol that will be interesting for our
purposes.  Nevertheless, Siemens, being strongly involved
in the activities of the group, may provide to AVISPA a
version of Protocol <B>Geopriv-nym (<SPAN CLASS="arabic">9</SPAN>)</B>, a pseudonym agreement protocol that could
be used in a geopriv architecture.

<P>
The properties of the pseudonym agreement, together
with the underlying geopriv protocol, give rise to the
following Problems: first, a temporal logic
property, namely, the location of the user should not
be sent to anyone without prior user consent; and
second a privacy property, namely the Location Server
(an involved third party) does not learn the real
identities of the user or the location recipient.

<P>
<EM>Protocol Geopriv-nym should provide Authn + ID Protection (Eavesdropper and Peer)&nbsp;
<BR>[1](G1,
<BR>[1]2,
<BR>[1]13,
<BR>[1]14).</EM>
