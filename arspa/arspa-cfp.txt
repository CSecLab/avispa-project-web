BACKGROUND, AIM AND SCOPE
=========================

  Experience over the last twenty years has shown that, even assuming
perfect cryptography, the design of security protocols (or cryptographic
protocols, as they are sometimes called) is highly error-prone and that
conventional validation techniques based on informal arguments and/or
testing are not up to the task.  It is now widely recognized that only
formal analysis can provide the level of assurance required by both the
developers and the users of the protocols.
  Work in this direction initially started in the security community but 
recently there has been a tremendous progress thanks to contributions 
from different automated reasoning communities, such as model checking,
resolution, planning, rewriting/narrowing, and higher-order theorem
proving. Moreover, there has been another wave of progress due to
research in applying non-classical logics, such as epistemic and belief
logics, to analyze protocols and their properties. 
  Based on this progress, a large number of formal methods and tools 
have been developed that have been quite successful in determining 
strengths and weaknesses of many protocols, i.e. in proving the
correctness of the protocols or in identifying attacks on them. Thus,
this progress can be seen as one of the recent success stories of the
automated reasoning community.

  The workshop aims to bring together researchers and practitioners from
both the security and the automated reasoning communities, from academia
and industry, who are working on developing and applying automated
reasoning techniques and tools for the formal specification and analysis
of security protocols.


Contributions are welcomed on the following topics or related ones:

- Automated analysis and verification of security protocols.
- Languages, logics and calculi for the design and specification of
  security protocols.
- Verification methods: accuracy, efficiency.
- Decidability and complexity of cryptographic verification problems.
- Synthesis and composition of security protocols.
- Integration of formal security specification, refinement and
  validation techniques in development methods and tools.



AUDIENCE
========

The workshop will be held on Sunday, July 04, 2004, and will be open to
all interested persons.



INVITED TALKS
=============

The technical program will include 
- presentations of the accepted papers,
- one or two invited talks, 
- a panel discussion "Bridging the analysis gap: from the Clark/Jacob
  library to Internet protocols".

Submissions should be at most 10 pages (a4paper, 11pt) and the cover
page should include title, names of authors, and the co-ordinates of the
corresponding author.

Please use LaTeX, with the following header:

Submissions must be received by the deadline of April 15,
2004. Notification of acceptance or rejection will be sent to the
authors no later than May 10, 2004. Final versions of accepted papers
must be received by June 01, 2004.



PUBLICATION

Accepted contributions will be included in the informal workshop
proceedings, which will be available at the workshop. As written in the
"Call for Workshop Proposals", a volume of ENTCS devoted to proceedings
of selected workshops is also anticipated.

Moreover, workshop participants will be invited to submit full
versions of their papers to a special issue of the Journal of
Automated Reasoning, which will be open also to non-participants, in
all cases with fresh reviewing.
