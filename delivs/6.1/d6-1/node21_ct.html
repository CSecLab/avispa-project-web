<P>
IP Security Protocol

<P>
Protocol <B>IKE (<SPAN CLASS="arabic">36</SPAN>)</B>, [<A HREF="node41_ct.html#RFC2409" TARGET="contents">81</A>], based on ISAKMP, Oakley,
and SKEME ([<A HREF="node41_ct.html#RFC2408" TARGET="contents">115</A>,<A HREF="node41_ct.html#RFC2412" TARGET="contents">140</A>,<A HREF="node41_ct.html#SKEME" TARGET="contents">102</A>]) is a quite
complex protocol with two different phases.  It is a
combination of 13 different subprotocols: in Phase I
there are 8 different subprotocols, with 2 choices for
mode, and 4 choices for authentication mechanism; in
Phase II there are 4 different subprotocols with the
choice of perfect forward secrecy or not and the
inclusion of explicit identity information or not;
lastly, there is a new group subprotocol.  There are also
variants depending on the types of credentials to be
used.

<P>
In Phase I, the two peers establish a secure channel for
further communication by negotiating ISAKMP SAs.  In
Phase II, protected by the SA negotiated in Phase I,
the peers negotiate SAs that can be used to protect
real communication; that is, the IPsec SA.  IKE defines
two Phase I modes: main mode gives authenticated key
exchange with identity protection.  Aggressive mode
gives quicker authenticated key exchange without
identity protection.  For Phase I, IKE defines (for
main and aggressive modes) four different
authentication methods: 1. authentication with digital
signatures; 2. authentication with public key
encryption; 3. authentication with a revised mode of
public key encryption; and 4. authentication with a
pre-shared key.

<P>
IKE is perceived as being too complex and it is
believed that it is only a matter of time before more
analyses show more serious security issues and problems
become apparent. Contradictions between the different
documents defining IKE have become evident (In
particular the rekeying issue: multiple SAs may be
pre-negotiated and used at will?)  Also possible
interaction of the different subprotocols, which use
similar formats, could lead to new insecurities.  (This
has been shown to be the case for an early version of
SSL, draft-benaloh-pct-00.txt, 1995)

<P>
<EM>Protocol IKE should provide Fresh Key Agreement, PFS, DoS Resilience, secure Negotiation, and ID Protection (Eavesdropper and Peer)&nbsp;
<BR>[1](G1-3,
<BR>[1]7,
<BR>[1]9-15).</EM>

<P>
Protocol <B>IKEv2 (<SPAN CLASS="arabic">37</SPAN>)</B>, the Internet Key Exchange Version 2 (IKEv2) Protocol,
[<A HREF="node41_ct.html#ipsec-ikev2" TARGET="contents">95</A>] consists of two
exchanges:

<P>
The first is an authentication and key exchange protocol which
establishes an IKE-SA.

<P>
The second one consists of messages and payloads which
focus on the negotiation of parameters in order to
establish IPsec security associations (i.e.,
Child-SAs). These payloads contain algorithm parameters
and traffic selector fields.

<P>
In addition to the above-mentioned parts IKEv2 also
includes some payloads and messages which allow
configuration parameters to be exchanged primarily for
remote access scenarios.

<P>
<EM>Protocol IKEv2 should provide Fresh Key Agreement, PFS, DoS Resilience, secure Negotiation&nbsp;
<BR>[1](G1-3,
<BR>[1]7,
<BR>[1]9-11,
<BR>[1]15).</EM>

<P>
Protocol <B>KINK (<SPAN CLASS="arabic">38</SPAN>)</B>, Kerberized Internet Negotiation of Keys,
(defined in [<A HREF="node41_ct.html#kink-kink" TARGET="contents">182</A>] and
[<A HREF="node41_ct.html#RFC3129" TARGET="contents">181</A>]) is a command/response protocol which
can create, delete and maintain IPsec security
associations ([<A HREF="node41_ct.html#RFC2401" TARGET="contents">98</A>]), as an alternative to
IKE ([<A HREF="node41_ct.html#RFC2409" TARGET="contents">81</A>]). Participating nodes use
Kerberos ([<A HREF="node41_ct.html#RFC1510" TARGET="contents">101</A>]) for key management, mutual
authentication, and replay protection.
KINK's design mitigates denial of service attacks by
requiring authenticated exchanges before the use of any
public key operations and the installation of any state.

<P>
<EM>Protocol KINK should provide Fresh Key Agreement, 3P-Authorization, and ID Protection (Eavesdropper and Peer)&nbsp;
<BR>[1](G1-3,
<BR>[1]6,
<BR>[1]7,
<BR>[1]10,
<BR>[1]12-14).</EM>

<P>
In the Ipsra (IP Security Remote Access) scenario
(remote users that use personal portable
computing devices, or who use Internet kiosks to access
private networks on the other side of an IPSEC
gateway), [<A HREF="node41_ct.html#RFC3456" TARGET="contents">145</A>]
(together with the authentication for DHCP messages,
[<A HREF="node41_ct.html#RFC3118" TARGET="contents">56</A>]) defines Protocol <B>DHCP-IPSec-tunnel (<SPAN CLASS="arabic">39</SPAN>)</B>, an exchange that is secured using IPsec, and as a
result the DHCP packets flowing between the remote host
and the security gateway are authenticated and
integrity protected.

<P>
<EM>Protocol DHCP-IPSec-tunnel should provide Authentication and Secrecy&nbsp;
<BR>[1](G1,
<BR>[1]2,
<BR>[1]12).</EM>
