% WARNING: The term xor(R2,ID) requires algebraic equation on the xor operator.

SUMMARY
  INCONCLUSIVE

COMMENTS
  The security protocol analyzed required support for some
  algebraic equations specified in the prelude file, while
  SATMC currently assumes free-algebra. Hence if operators
  like exp or xor occur in the IF specification, then the
  analysis is inconclusive and it is not performed.
