<PRE>
I have been playing with AVISPA for the past few days. Overall my
impressions are very positive. It is a great piece of software, the
installation is painless, the documentation is good and overall I found
it a lot easier to use than some of the other tools in the same space.

I do, however, have a few gripes:

* The xemacs mode. It does a great job of syntax highlighting. However,
it is suffering from the following shortcomings/bugs:
  - no indentation support
  - the buffer refresh in the compile cycle is erratic - sometimes the
result buffers refresh automatically, sometimes they don't, and at other
times I get duplicate buffers (..&lt;2&gt; etc)
  - the compilation does not report any errors; one can find them by
switching to the compilation buffer, but that is not at all obvious
  - the error locations in the compilation buffer are not of a format
that emacs recognises, which makes navigating to error locations
difficult


* Non-executable models. As mentioned in the manual &amp; tutorial, and
evidenced by my own observations, it is very easy to make mistakes that
result in the model becoming partially un-executable and the model
checker consequently reporting success. The tutorial suggests using the
-p option to step through the states. However, that is extremely tedious
for anything but the most trivial models.

Would it be possible to perform an automated check that all transitions
in a model are reachable and can fire? That, I think, would catch most
of the cases of non-executable models.


* Secure channels. Currently, the only type of channel supported by the
modelling language are Dolev-Yao channels. For modelling complex systems
I find myself wanting to decompose roles into smaller entities but since
the insecure D-Y channels are the only form of communication available
this introduces spurious vulnerabilities.

The same problem arises more generally when trying to model systems
where parts of the communication are impervious to attack. Would it be
possible to introduce a secure channel type?


* Web interface. The downloadable distribution of AVISPA does not appear
to contain the web interface and the trace-&gt;msc converter. Would it be
possible to make these available?


* Typed vs un-typed. In a number of cases I encountered models where I
though an attack was possible but AVISPA declared the protocol safe. On
closer inspection that turned out to be due to types. In one example
there was a replay attack possible if a text type could be interpreted
as a symmetric key type. Whether that attack is possible in reality
depends on the crypto used. Turning off type-checking resulted in the
attack being found. It's probably worth pointing that out in the
manual/tutorial.


Regards,

Matthias
