<P>
SET (Secure Electronic Transaction),
Protocol <B>SET (<SPAN CLASS="arabic">71</SPAN>)</B>, defined in [<A HREF="node41_ct.html#SET" TARGET="contents">114</A>], is an immense e-commerce
technical standard for the commerce industry developed
by Visa and MasterCard as a way to facilitate secure
payment card transactions over the Internet using
Digital Certificates.

<P>
Protocol <B>EDI (<SPAN CLASS="arabic">72</SPAN>)</B>, the Electronic Data Interchange, is a
set of protocols for conducting structured
inter-organization exchanges, such as for making
purchases or initiating loan requests. [<A HREF="node41_ct.html#RFC1767" TARGET="contents">50</A>]
(MIME Encapsulation of EDI Objects) defined the
method for packaging the EDI transactions sets in a
MIME envelope. The RFC MIME-based Secure Peer-to-Peer
Business Data Interchange over the Internet
([<A HREF="node41_ct.html#RFC3335" TARGET="contents">80</A>]) introduces the notion of
non-repudiation of receipt (NRR), used to notify a
sending trading partner that requested the signed
receipt that: The receiving trading partner
acknowledges receipt of the sent EDI Interchange,
(Problem: Non-Repudiation), the receiving trading
partner has authenticated the sender of the EDI
Interchange (Problem: Entity Authentication), and the
receiving trading partner has verified the integrity of
the sent EDI Interchange (Problem: Message
Authentication).

<P>
Protocol <B>TRADE (<SPAN CLASS="arabic">73</SPAN>)</B>, the Internet Open Trading Protocol
is an interoperable framework for Internet commerce. It
is optimized for the case where the buyer and the
merchant do not have a prior acquaintance and is
payment system independent. It can encapsulate and
support payment systems such as SET, Mondex, secure
channel card payment, GeldKarte, etc. IOTP is able to
handle cases where such merchant roles as the shopping
site, the payment handler, the deliverer of goods or
services, and the provider of customer support are
performed by different Internet sites.

<P>
<EM> Protocol SET,
Protocol EDI, and
Protocol TRADE should provide Non-Repudiation (Accountability, Proof of Origin, and Proof of Delivery)&nbsp;
<BR>[1](G1-3,
<BR>[1]13,
<BR>[1]17-19).</EM>
(Plus other standard Authentication goals).
