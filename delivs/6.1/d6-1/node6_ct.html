Context Transfer, Handoff Candidate Discovery,
and Dormant Mode Host Alerting

<P>
The Context Transfer Protocol Protocol <B>seamoby-ctp (<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN>)</B>
is a protocol used whan a MN is moving (or may be
moving) from one router to another, allowing state
information to be transferred between edge mobility
devices. Examples of state information that could be
useful to transfer include AAA information, security
context, QoS properties assigned to the user, Robust
Header Compression information, etc.
[<A HREF="node41_ct.html#RFC3374" TARGET="contents">96</A>] explains the main reasons why Context
Transfer procedures may be useful in IP networks.

<P>
[<A HREF="node41_ct.html#seamoby-ctp" TARGET="contents">109</A>] describes the protocol, but
security details are missing. We assume that the
protocol will be fully specified within the next 6
months, or we will make assumptions about the missing
details. The current proposal seems to be enough to construct
a model for verification purposes.  It proceeds roughly as
follows: assume that a mobile node MN moves from one
previous access router pAR to a new one, nAR, and that
the two ARs have established a secure channel in advance
(for instance over IPSec). To be more specific, we
restrict ourselves to the case in which the context transfer is
request by MN, the mobile node.
Then either one or both of the pAR and nAR
authenticates MN and authorizes the MN's
credentials before authorizing the context transfer and
release of context to the mobile.
This should prevent the possibility of rogue MNs
launching DoS attacks by sending large number of CT
requests as well as
causing a large number of context transfers between
ARs.
Another consideration is that the mobile provides an
authentication ``cookie'' to be included with the
context transfer message sent from the pAR to the nAR
and confirmed by the MN at the nAR.

<P>
The most important properties here are temporal
properties, for instance, if the context of
a MN is moved to a certain AR, then the MN has
indeed requested the context transfer.
The protocol also has authentication and secrecy requirements,
including that the ARs authenticate the MN and
vice-versa, and that the MN
authenticates the authentication cookie (sent
originally by itself) presented by the new AR.
