Hi there,

Found two specs at http://avispa-project.org/library/index.html :
http://avispa-project.org/library/SET-purchase.html
and
http://avispa-project.org/library/SET-purchase-honest-payment-gateway.html

The hlpsl spec for each is at the bottom half of the page. 

Cheers,

Ilham

hi , 
  i know that the replay attack exists on TLS protocol (since the server  decrypt all messages sent by the client )but it's not mentionned in TLS spec .
  i would like to know why.
  thx

Subject: [Avispa-users] OFMC: exponentiation support question
Message-ID: <1146489269.8544.48.camel@riset-a-s1-112.riset.cs.ui.ac.id>

Hi all,

I have been trying to verify the authentication protocol B proposed by
European Telecommunications Standard Institute and used in
authentication part of Horn-Preneel UTMSPayment protocol. 

The protocol uses exponentiation as shown in Alice-Bob model below:

U -> V: exp(g,u)
V -> U: r; h2(K; r; V); Timestamp; certV     where K = h1(exp(g,u),v)
U -> V: {Sig_U(h3(exp(g,u); exp(g,v); r; V; Timestamp; Alpha_T); certU; 
         Alpha_T}_K

h1, h2, and h3 are hash functions; u and r are nonces, while v is the
private key of V and exp(g,v) is V's public key. 

When I tested my complete model using OFMC as backend with sessco option
on, the following message appeared. 

  ofmc: OFMC can't see how the protocol can be executed.
  See manual for more information.

I have reduced the HLPSL file (attached) to a model of which this
behaviour is still observable. 

Have I used the exponentiation function incorrectly such that OFMC
rejects my specification?

Thank you very much for your trouble.

Regards,

Ilham Kurnia

Hi, 

I've tried compiling your specification and got a different error:

%% Syntax error: Line 24, Col 31 (offset 696-697, string ":=")
%%   Syn.Err(16): invalid transition: missing "/\", label, action or "end role" keyword

>        State' := 3    /\ K_icc := new() %Generate keying material.
>                            /\ M_icc := Hash (Rnd_icc.Rnd_ifd.K_icc') 

Regarding the error above, I think that you need to put a prime (') when 
assigning new values. 

If you still have that strange init error, try to redownload avispa. Maybe 
that will help.

Hello

Thanks for the help!

Some additional questions:

I want to concatenate  the variables Rnd_icc, Rnd_ifd and K_icc for
input to a hash function(e.g. SHA-1) to make a new variable that is
called M_icc.
I have tried to accomplish this by using the command below, but it does
not compile.


/\ M_icc := Hash (Rnd_icc.Rnd_ifd.K_icc')

Did you declare all three variables Rnd_icc, Rnd_ifd and K_icc?
This was not the case in the spec you sent in the previous e-mail.
Note also that even when declared, this should not work, as Rnd_ifd is never
learned (that is learned in a received message, RCV(... Rnd_ifd' ...), or
assigned  in the right-hand side of a transition, Rnd_ifd':=...).

One more recommendation: do not use the word "hash" for a constant, as in the
very next release this will be a keyword... ;)

Laurent.

BACKGROUND, AIM AND SCOPE
=========================

Computer security is an established field of computer science of both
theoretical and practical significance. In recent years, there has been
increasing interest in logic-based foundations for various methods in
computer security, including the formal specification, analysis and
design of security protocols and their applications, the formal
definition of various aspects of security such as access control
mechanisms, mobile code security and denial-of-service attacks, and the
modeling of information flow and its application to confidentiality
policies, system composition, and covert channel analysis.

The workshop FCS-ARSPA'06 is the fusion of two workshops. The workshop
FCS continues a tradition, initiated with the Workshops on Formal
Methods and Security Protocols (FMSP) in 1998 and 1999, then with the
Workshop on Formal Methods and Computer Security (FMCS) in 2000, and
finally with the LICS satellite Workshop on Foundations of Computer
Security (FCS) in 2002 through 2005, of bringing together formal methods
and the security community.

The ARSPA workshop is the third in a series of workshops on Automated
Reasoning for Security Protocol Analysis, bringing together researchers
and practitioners from both the security and the formal methods
communities, from academia and industry, who are working on developing
and applying automated reasoning techniques and tools for the formal
specification and analysis of security protocols. The first two ARSPA
workshops were held as satellite events of IJCAR'04 and of ICALP'05,
respectively.

The aim of the joint workshop FCS-ARSPA'06 is to provide a forum for
continued activity in these areas, to bring computer security
researchers in closer contact with the LICS community, and to give LICS
attendees an opportunity to talk to experts in computer security. We
thus solicit submissions of papers both on mature work and on work in
progress.

We are interested both in new results in theories of computer security
and also in more exploratory presentations that examine open questions
and raise fundamental concerns about existing theories, as well as in
new results on developing and applying automated reasoning techniques
and tools for the formal specification and analysis of security
protocols.

Possible topics include, but are not limited to:

Automated reasoning techniques       Access control and resource usage control
Composition issues                   Authentication
Formal specification                 Availability and denial of service
Foundations of verification          Covert channels
Information flow analysis            Confidentiality
Language-based security              Integrity and privacy
Logic-based design              for  Intrusion detection
Program transformation               Malicious code
Security models                      Mobile code
Static analysis                      Mutual distrust
Statistical methods                  Privacy
Tools                                Security policies
Trust management                     Security protocols

All submissions will be peer-reviewed. Authors of accepted papers must
guarantee that their paper will be presented at the workshop.

BACKGROUND, AIM AND SCOPE
=========================

Computer security is an established field of computer science of both
theoretical and practical significance. In recent years, there has been
increasing interest in logic-based foundations for various methods in
computer security, including the formal specification, analysis and
design of security protocols and their applications, the formal
definition of various aspects of security such as access control
mechanisms, mobile code security and denial-of-service attacks, and the
modeling of information flow and its application to confidentiality
policies, system composition, and covert channel analysis.

The workshop FCS-ARSPA'06 is the fusion of two workshops. The workshop
FCS continues a tradition, initiated with the Workshops on Formal
Methods and Security Protocols (FMSP) in 1998 and 1999, then with the
Workshop on Formal Methods and Computer Security (FMCS) in 2000, and
finally with the LICS satellite Workshop on Foundations of Computer
Security (FCS) in 2002 through 2005, of bringing together formal methods
and the security community.

The ARSPA workshop is the third in a series of workshops on Automated
Reasoning for Security Protocol Analysis, bringing together researchers
and practitioners from both the security and the formal methods
communities, from academia and industry, who are working on developing
and applying automated reasoning techniques and tools for the formal
specification and analysis of security protocols. The first two ARSPA
workshops were held as satellite events of IJCAR'04 and of ICALP'05,
respectively.

The aim of the joint workshop FCS-ARSPA'06 is to provide a forum for
continued activity in these areas, to bring computer security
researchers in closer contact with the LICS community, and to give LICS
attendees an opportunity to talk to experts in computer security. We
thus solicit submissions of papers both on mature work and on work in
progress.

We are interested both in new results in theories of computer security
and also in more exploratory presentations that examine open questions
and raise fundamental concerns about existing theories, as well as in
new results on developing and applying automated reasoning techniques
and tools for the formal specification and analysis of security
protocols.

Possible topics include, but are not limited to:

Automated reasoning techniques       Access control and resource usage control
Composition issues                   Authentication
Formal specification                 Availability and denial of service
Foundations of verification          Covert channels
Information flow analysis            Confidentiality
Language-based security              Integrity and privacy
Logic-based design              for  Intrusion detection
Program transformation               Malicious code
Security models                      Mobile code
Static analysis                      Mutual distrust
Statistical methods                  Privacy
Tools                                Security policies
Trust management                     Security protocols

All submissions will be peer-reviewed. Authors of accepted papers must
guarantee that their paper will be presented at the workshop.

Subject: [Avispa-users] Timestamp question
Message-ID: <1147147874.11411.28.camel@riset-a-s1-112.riset.cs.ui.ac.id>

Hi all,

I have seen several protocol models in AVISPA library that use
timestamp, such as Kerberos and APOP. In those models, timestamp is
always assigned with new(). The user manual states new() as creating a
nonce. However, the timestamp concept is not just about giving it some
random value. At the very least, the random value should be a sequence
number. 

Could anyone be so kind to explain/refer to an article the justification
of the assignment of new() to timestamp in protocol modelling in HLPSL?

Sincerely yours,

Ilham

you're right, the modeling of timestamps via nonces is not really
adequate. When having a closer look at the models, you will notice
that the "timestamps" are used as (not much more than) placeholders.
They get initialized, but if used at all, then for equality testing.

The problem is that HLPSL (and in particular the backends) do not
support time, and neither arithmetic. Counters can be simulated
to some extent using terms like "succ(succ(succ(zero)))", as done
e.g. for the tesla.hlpsl formalization. Maybe this little trick is
sufficient for your purposes, too.

Sincerely,
	David

Hi Ilham and David,

I have a slightly different view on this. Since this was an issue
often discussed, let me give a brief summary.

Please keep in mind that our models are abstracting away a lot of
details of cryptography. From such an abstract viewpoint there is not
much difference between the least significant bits of a timestamp and
a nonce -- in particular they are both unpredicatable. (Though the
upper bits of the timestamp are not, and they may allow dictionary
attacks.) In fact, what timestamps should achieve is to limit the time
window in which a message is accepted by a recipient and thus limiting
the replay of messages. So what we did in AVISPA was to use *weak*
authentication instead of the standard authentication as a goal: all
those attacks are ignored, in which some participant merely accepts
something several times, since such attacks are easily prevented by
the timestamp mechanism. So we don't have to think about complicated
models with precise notions of time, intervals, expiration times ...

Note, however, that in such a setting even minor authentication
problems (that seem negligible) may have consequences on the timestamp
mechanism of the "real" protocol: e.g. in Wide-Mouth-Frog protocol, a
small authentication problem leads to the possibility that the
intruder keeps a session "alive" forever (and this consequence we
cannot see in our model). 

Regards,
Sebastian

I have just had a look at it and I found a few minor problems (I am
using a newer, not yet released version of HLPSL2IF which gives out
more warnings):

- exp is declared as a function in the main call. As exp is
"built-in" in HLPSL, this is not allowed.

- For some reason the HLPSL2IF compiler seems to have trouble with
translating calling a role with a term that involves the exp function
symbol, i.e. I get an error for 
   user(..., exp(g,kv), ...)
but not for
   user(..., g.kv, ...)

  [of course, this is not a mistake of yours!]

- the same problem appears in the initial intruder knowledge 

It is quite difficult to work around this, so I would like to ask
Laurent (who wrote HLPSL2IF) to maybe have a look at it. 

Anyway, I have attached a specification that now goes through HLPSL2IF
and is executable in OFMC. (However I have removed the certificates for
the user and the intruder which I couldn't work around.)


Ciao,
Sebastian

Message-ID: <4460F0EC.4050602@rub.de>

Cheers to you all!
I'm a novice to AVISPA and i'm currently working on a project as
seminar-work at my university.
I must make a walkthrough ,how AVISPA works and diskuss the OFMC model
checker .
So,as a novice i would ask you for some hints:
1)i got the AVISPA tool as a linux binary::
--i tried to run the binary with cygwin ,but probably i need something
more ,for to use the tool under windows
--i'm not worried abot the OS ,cuz i can do a vmware Knoppix live OS and
run the tool in it ,but i wanted to ask if there is a workaround with
cygwin;
you know on my laptop i have only WinXP ;(( and i don't have enough
space to make a dualboot system,emulating Knoppix is as above no Problem
,but if there is a chance for
easier way of running AVISPA tool under WinXP ,i would be very glad for
your suggestions
2) i downloaded also the OFMC model checker for Linux and Windows,so if
there is a version for OFMC for windows ,how should i implement it in
the AVISPA tool?
3) i must stress and test a very cryptographic protocol using OFMC and
diskuss the results ::
--what kind or which protocol is worth to test with OFMC ,so i can make
my seminar-work
--my work should be about 20-25 pages in latex,so you can imagine its
like a student project,so i really do not need to go really in depth
,but it should be make (this work) good as well,that's why i need also:
4) somekind of good manuals for using AVISPA and OFMC;
i got the  D. Basin, S. M?dersheim, L. Vigan?, *OFMC: A symbolic model
checker for security protocols* ::
http://www.avispa-project.org/papers/ofmc-jis05.pdf
what other kind of white pappers could be usable for me...
Many Thanks in advance!

Kindest regards!

Hi Krassen, 

With regard to number 1, I have no clue. Never tried it on Windows.

Number 2: 
Translate your HLPSL file using hlpsl2if program to IF file, and then
use it as a parameter to the ofmc program. 

e.g. From the avispa-1.0 main directory, execute the following:
     
     ./bin/translator/hlpsl2if yourhlpslfile.hlpsl

    It should produce yourhlpslfile.if in the avispa-1.0 main directory.

    After that, you can copy the IF specification file to Windows and
    run OFMC in command prompt.

    ofmc yourhlpslfile.if -any-options-you-need

Number 4: 
* In the AVISPA package, there's a documentation directory (docs) which
  contains a tutorial (docs/tutorial/Tutorial.pdf) and a user manual
  (docs/user-manual/user-manual.pdf). I found the tutorial quite 
  thorough for basic usage. The user manual should provide more details
  should you need them. The user manual also contains a section (S3.2)
  how to analyze a IF specifications using the provided backends
  (including OFMC). 

* If you need a quick background on AVISPA, this AVISPA team has written
  a 5 page white paper:
  http://www.avispa-project.org/papers/avispa-cav05.ps

  A list of other papers written by members of the AVISPA team can be
  found here:
  http://www.avispa-project.org/talks.html

* There's also lecture notes by Duminda Wijesekera on AVISPA. 
 
  http://www.ise.gmu.edu/~duminda/classes/fall05/myAvispaNew.ppt

* If you need more background on the protocol verification itself, 
  I found the slides from "Formal Methods for Information Security"
  course at ETH Z?rich to be excellent reading material. 

  http://www.infsec.ethz.ch/education/ss04/Formis_Material 

  The last half of the course talks about formal security protocol
  verification. 

* More info about the OFMC:
  http://www.inf.ethz.ch/personal/moedersheim/research/ofmc-doc.tgz

  It has two user guides, and background literature on OFMC.

I hope this helps. 

Cheers,

Ilham

Hello Ilham Kurnia,
i'm really greatly appreciated about what you've given to me as
suggestions /links in your reply!
I checked out the papers ,i think they should be more than helpful for me ;)
Is it a problem ,if i write to you on your e-mail address too?
Still last question ,if not annoying:
anykind of suggestion ,what should i take as an example/test
(crypto/internet security) protocol for the OFMC tool ?
-is it odd to try to make tests with IPsec and comment the results or
should i take something easier?(sorry, for the dull question ,but really
have no clue how should i start ...)
-as i said i need to choose one of the 38 modern cryptographic security
internet protocols ,test the chosen one with OFMC,discuss the stress
tests and the results...
-for demonstrating the output of the AVISPA tool should i use the
web-based interface:
http://www.avispa-project.org/web-interface/expert.php

As i said,i'm really thankful for your input!

best from,

krassen

cheers tu you all,
  i'm new user of the avispa tool , and in my protocol i will use certificate exchange of all participants in the negociation sub protocol , 
  my question is :
  how can i verify authentication(strong&weak) ,non repudiation  if the messages are all encrypted with symmetric key which are themselves transported in digital envelopes
  the alice&bob notation is : 
  A ->B : {M}_k . {k}_pubA . sig
  M is the message
  k  symmetric key 
  pubA the public key of A
  sig is signature of A

Subject: [Avispa-users] Can Avispa assume compromised session keys?

Hi users,

I would like to know if in Avispa tool we may initially assume 
compromised session keys. For example, Paulson approach uses an operator 
called "oops" for modelling possible lost of session keys. I know that 
in HLPSL specification, session keys are modelled with new(), this is a 
random form. However,  I don't know if it is possible to assume that a 
session key is within the intruder knowledge.

For stating that I'm looking for, the following example is given:

Kao Chow Authentication v.1 protocol has the following Alice&Bob notation:
1. A -> S : A, B, Na
2. S -> B : {A, B, Na, Kab}Kas, {A, B, Na, Kab}Kbs
3. B -> A : {A, B, Na, Kab}Kas, {Na}Kab, Nb
4. A -> B : {Nb}Kab
where Kas is a symmetric key, Na is a nonce and Kab is a session key.

I know that this protocol suffers an attack when an older session key 
Kab has been compromised.
i.1.  A    -> S   : A, B, Na
i.2.  S    -> B   : {A, B, Na, Kab}Kas, {A, B, Na, Kab}Kbs
         assume that Kab is compromised
ii.1.      Omitted
ii.2. I(S) -> B   : {A, B, Na, Kab}Kas, {A, B, Na, Kab}Kbs
ii.3. B    -> I(A): {A, B, Na, Kab}Kas, {Na}Kab, N'b
ii.4. I(A) -> B   : {N'b}Kab
The result is agent B accepts Kab like a key shared with A in another 
different session to the orginal one, whereas the intruder knows Kab.

I hope someone may help me ...

Thanks a lot for your trouble .....

Hi Juan Carlos,

In HLPSL, you can compromise a session key by adding as last step of the
protocol that it is added to the intruder knowledge:
     State=... /\ ... =|> State':=... /\ iknows(Kab)
The predicate iknows() can be used in any transition to add some knowledge to
the intruder.

Dear Sebastian, 

Thank you very much for your reply. 

My response below is based on the HLPSL2IF given in the AVISPA package.

> I have just had a look at it and I found a few minor problems (I am

Originally, I didn't declare exp function in the environment role (I
presume this is what you mean by the main call). However HLPSL2IF
rejects it by throwing "unknown type of constant exp" warnings which
eventually ends with a Not_found exception. By declaring the exp
function as a constant in the environment role, HLPSL2IF translates the
HLPSL file to IF without any warnings.

> 
> - the same problem appears in the initial intruder knowledge 

I have checked the IF file produced by HLPSL2IF. It seems to generate
the correct IF specification. I also managed to run the protocol using
CL-AtSe (version 2.2-3, release date 8 April 2006) and get the run trace
I want. Please find the revised specification attached. 

Best regards,

Ilham

Nice that this solution gives the flexibility to let the intruder learn
a value from a specific point in the protocol run, even conditionally,
and that the value may have been computed on-the-fly.

In the very simple case that a value X is determined in advance and
shall be compromised right from the beginning of the protocol run,
there is an even simpler solution: just include X in the global
intruder_knowledge set declared in the environment role.

In this case, the intruder will learn each session key "Kab" generated

In this situation: including X in the global intruder_knowledge set,  
could coincide that a new session key Kab originated and distributed 
from the trusted server to be equal with X ?,


Thanks again for the soluctions...

Hi Juan Carlos,

Yes - I guess you mean in a transition like

>>>      State  = ... /\ ... /\ Kab' := new()
     =|> State':= ... /\ iknows(Kab')

> In this situation: including X in the global intruder_knowledge set,

No - because the newly generated Kab is fresh, it is different from
any other value used anywhere before (in the system run history).

Best,

Well, this is not the kind of example I was thinking about...
If you compromise a fresh key in the same step as it is generated, this does not
correspond to a property of short secrecy (that is a secret just for the current
session).
The step where the key is generated is stil something like:
       State=... /\ ... /\ Rcv(...)
   =|> State':=... /\ ... /\ Kab':=new() /\ Snd(...Kab'...)
And in the very last step of the protocol (if possible in the role that has
generated the key), you add the iknows() predicate:
       State=... /\ ... /\ Rcv(...)
   =|> State':=... /\ iknows(Kab)

Yes, the older version of HLPSL2IF seems to have a bug here. Obviously
you should not be declaring built-in functions. Our current internal
version doesn't accept this (but, as said, has some other difficulty
with your HLPSL example). 

I have checked it against the HLPSL2IF from AVISPA package and using
the option "-untyped" with OFMC, the protocol is executable
and you get an attack trace.

The typing mistakes that were the trouble are the above "exp", and the
declaration of "Alpha_T" as a type "text" (should be "message").

Sebastian

That output is due to a small bug: when OFMC changes the search
strategy during a large search, the nodes are not longer
counted. Sorry about that.

Dear guys,

I am new in HLPSL. I have a quick question

 I have following assumption.

 Tnew=Told =|> 
 % Comparison of Tnew and Told variable
 
 Tnew'=Told =|> 
 % Comaprison of new value of Tnew with Told
 
 Tnew':=Told=|> 
 % Assignment of value of Told to Tnew


Please, correct me or confirm me in my concept

waiting for prompt reply

Hi Syed,

> I am new in HLPSL. I have a quick question

>  Tnew=Told =|> 
>  % Comparison of Tnew and Told variable

correct.

>  
>  Tnew'=Told =|> 
>  % Comparison of new value of Tnew with Told

correct.

>  Tnew':=Told=|> 
>  % Assignment of value of Told to Tnew

This looks like an assignment, but cannot be specified
on the LHS of =|> . Just move it to the RHS.

Subject: [Avispa-users] iknows
Message-ID: <446DE686.1030404@hig.no>

Hi

I have a question regarding the intruder knowledge function(iknows).

My protocol has a symmetic key K_ENC known by A and B.
I want to verify that my protocol is working, as spesified.
So I tried to introduce iknows(K_ENC) into the protocol.

But avispa does not find an attack trace, although  the encryption key
is known to the intruder.

How is that possible?

The goal of secrecy of K_icc and K_ifd sould also be broken, right?

The protocol:

    SND, RCV: channel (dy))

Hi Jon Fredrik,

What backend did you use for this?
I do not know how they all work with such iknows() predicates, but in
general cl-atse works fine and should find the attack.

Hi

I have tried running the cl-atse back-end with ''iknows(K_ENC)'' both in
the Alice and Bob roles.

But cl-atse does not find an attack trace.

Yes, sure. But there are some mistakes in your protocol specification
that prevent the protocol from being executable:

- in the first transition of role bob, the value Rnd_icc should be
learned from the incoming message. Thus, you should replace in this
transition all occurrences of Rnd_icc with Rnd_icc' 

-> after this change an attack is found by the avispa tool

- you should do this for other variables too, e.g. K_ifd and
Rnd_ifd, otherwise you get an attack with lots of "dummy_nonce"
because you are using uninitialized variables.

- in role session you probably mean "bob(A,B,...)" rather than
"bob(B,A,...)"

- also note that you declare that all agents are using the same shared
key, i.e. session(a,b,k_enc,k_mac...)  session(a,i,k_enc,k_mac) etc.
That's probably not what you want.

- Also I have seen that you have declared a variable M_icc:text, but
then assign a composed value to it. You should rather use a composed
type or simply M_icc:message. (Note that the typed models in protocol
analysis in general are quite different from type systems in
functional programming languages.)

That's all the mistakes I have spotted by looking at it, hope this is
helpful. In general, my suggestion is to use the executability checks
and even the step-by-step simulation of the protocol to convince
yourself that your specification is what you want.

Ciao,
Sebastian

Message-ID: <20060524111651.92122.qmail@web33408.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hi all,

As part of a research on the AVISPA tool I am trying
to evaluate the Needham-Schroeder protocol with
symmetric keys with the server so that I will be able
to conclude if the tool finds the known Denning-Sacco
attack on this protocol. My protocol specification is
as such:

A -> S : A,B,na
S -> A : {na,B,Kab,{Kab,A}_Kbs}_Kas
A -> B : {Kab,A}_Kbs
B -> A : {nb}_Kab
A -> B : {nb-1}_Kab

where Kas and Kbs are the keys shared between A and S
and B and S respectively, Kab is the generated key
from the server and na,nb are nonces. I would like to
ask you if there is a specific way to model the
protocol so that this attack is found (using a
compromised key Kab from a previous session).

Here is my HLSPL file:

I tried to run it both with OFMC and CL-Atse but no
attack is found. Is there a problem with my
specification? Any help would be very much
appreciated.

Dear Yann,
   
  an attack is indeed found but it is not correct. When bob uses the predicate witness the role B should be the first argument of the predicate witness with A being the second such as B declares he is the peer to A generating the nonce Nb for the authentication of the bob_alice_nb. A possible mistake - if any - should be somewhere else. Still I guess that Avispa should be able to find the Denning Sacco attack. 
   
  Regards,
Kostas

  ok,
Try this specification, I change the witness function in the bob role. 
And OFMC and ATSE find an attack.
But I don't know if is the attack you want to find ?

Subject: [Avispa-users] Can AVISPA verify Chaum's Dining Cryptographers
	protocol?
Message-ID: <20060526081632.28977.qmail@web15607.mail.cnb.yahoo.com>

Hi all,
   
  Some papers said that model checkers based on temporal logic and Dolev-Yao model can not verify Chaum's Dining Cryptographers protocol because some necessary knowledge can not be modelled. 
   
  Knowledge of intruder and honest agents can be expressed using HLPSL.
   
  Can AVISPA verify Chaum's Dining Cryptographers protocol? And why?
   
  Best regards,
   
  Liu Jifeng

Message-ID: <7d8ff4850605290501g50ead69fw6579cadcbcb134b4@mail.gmail.com>

        Hello everyone,
I have a question related to LTL formulas. In the user's manual the
following is stated in a footnote:

"LTL formulas are handled by the translator, but in the current version of
the AVISPA tool, no backend does use them."

Does this mean that I can use my own LTL formulas or not, I'm kind of
confused about this ?

Thanks you for your trouble,
Lucian Variu

Hi all!!!
I am a new user of Avispa. I am on the last year at the polish Technical University. I have to make some project, that why I need to use Avispa. I have started to use Avispa but I have some problem with some operation. I want to change a little bit the Iso3 protocol, I want to add encipher operation, but when I want to do it the OMFC is saying OFMC can't see how the protocol can be executed.
See manual for more information. I am going to add my project. Please let me know what is wrong, it is realy importan for me.
Have a nice day

Hi Marieta,

I've looked into your specification.
In the role iso3_Resp, try changing

Snd({{A.K2'.Nb'}_inv(Pkbs).B.Na}_Pkae)

to

Snd({{A.K2'.Nb'}_inv(Pkbs).B.Na'}_Pkae)

Beside that, in the environment role, add protocol_id k1 and k2, and in each
role, add local variables na,nb,k1,k2 as protocol_id.

I hope this helps.

Regards,

Ilham

You may want to consider rereading the tutorial. 
AFAIK, if you don't use Na' in your iso3_Resp role, then it will use the
old Na stored in the role at the state where it is used. In your case,
that old value is undefined (or unitialized). 

Cheers,

Ilham

I mean that coused (maybe) new value of Na, but I want to keep the first one from the first step of my protocol.

Hi all!
I have a very basic question regarding hlpsl. In the avispa user guide there is a hlpsl specification of the needham schroeder protocol. On page 33 in the role nspk there is a line i cannot make sense of. 
/\_{in(A.B.Ka.Kb, Instances)}
This is part of the composition part. 
What does thios mean? I found another specification of the same protocol which is identical, execpt that the above line is missing. Also, the parameter instances is missing altogether in this other specification. What is this parameter for? Sorry for this kind of dumb question but i just cannot make sense out of that. Thanks for your help!
Kind regards Franziska

Hello Franziska,

> /\_{in(A.B.Ka.Kb, Instances)}

This is one way of specifying the sessions to be analyzed.  This  
should be read as the parallel composition over all A.B.Ka.Kb in the  
set Instances, where Instances is a set of type  
(agent.agent.public_key.public_key) set.  What follows is probably  
something along the lines of
    Alice(A,Ka,...)
/\ Bob(B,Kb,...)

So this says, for each pair of agents and public keys in the set  
Instances, instantiate one Alice role and one Bob role.

This is not really deprecated, but it is rarely used these days.

In general, we tend to write specifications with one role called  
"session" which starts a single initiator, a single responder, and  
perhaps other roles if they are required for a full session of the  
protocol.  Then, rather than defining our analysis scenario by a set  
Instances, we simply instantiate one "session" role within the  
environment for each session we want to analyze.

I hope this helps.

Paul.

Subject: [Avispa-users] Error message
Message-ID: <20060530112732.186270@gmx.net>

Hi!
Sorry for the  spam, but now I am facing a different problem: When trying to run my protocol with the options the computation stops after ca. 30 secs of running and produces the following error message:
avispa schroeder.hlpsl --cl -atse -ns -lr 
//opt/avispa/bin/backends/cl.bash: line 125: 1601 killed
/cl/cl-atse $_unknown

If I try to run it without any options I get the following error straight away:

Fail: There are not enough numbers in the state fact [PCompT "agent" [PVar "50"],PCompT "public_key" [PVar "51"],PVar "52",PCompT "agent" [PVar "57"],PCompT "agent" [PVar "58"],PCompT "public_key" [PVar "59"],PCompT "nat" [PVar "56"]]

What is that supposed to mean?? I am running AVISPA under colinux with a debian distribution. I have a 1024 SWAP file and 512 MB of RAM. Am I running out of memory with the first option? But why in this case does the ofmc produce an error straight away?
I attached my hlpsl file. Hope anyone can help me. Thanks a lot.
Franziska

Hi,

I am a novice user and have a question regarding the semantics of
HLPSL. Assume the following piece of code:

...
local M' : message
...
1. State = 0 /\ Rcv(M') /\ M' = (a certain pattern)
=|> State' := 1 /\ ...

and this is the only transition at State = 1.

What happens if some message is received, but the condition on the
pattern is not satisfied? Some options are:

- the message is disregarded (implicit self-loop at state 0)
- the agent enters a state where all transitions are enabled
- the agent enters a deadlock state
...

I have tried to guess the behaviour using OFMC in "path mode", but
with the intruder interfering it is hard to see what happens.

BTW, is it possible to disable the intruder? This would simplify
initial debugging/simulation, before going into verification.

 Thanks in advance for your help,

 Vlad
