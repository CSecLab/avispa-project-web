which took place as a satellite event of ICALP'05, we are guest-editing
a Special Issue of Theoretical Computer Science devoted to original
papers on formal security protocol specification, analysis and
verification.
<p>


Contributions are welcomed on the following topics and related ones:
<ul>
<li>Automated analysis and verification of security protocols.</li>
<li>Languages, logics, and calculi for the design and specification of
security protocols.</li>
<li>Verification methods: accuracy, efficiency.</li>
<li>Decidability and complexity of cryptographic verification
problems.</li> 
<li>Synthesis and composition of security protocols.</li>
<li>Integration of formal security specification, refinement and
validation techniques in development methods and tools.</li>
</ul><p>
