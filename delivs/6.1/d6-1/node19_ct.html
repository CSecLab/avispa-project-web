Inter-Domain Routing

<P>
Attacks on Routing Protocols are a major problem for
the Internet.  If an attacker is able to corrupt or
modify routing tables as he chooses, he has a great
amount of power to mount further attacks or simply to
create massive DoS attacks.  The IETF has been
seriously concerned about these threats and has started
a set of working items to deal with them.

<P>
The current proposal for the Border Gateway Protocol (Version 4, BGP-4)
is described in [<A HREF="node41_ct.html#idr-bgp4" TARGET="contents">158</A>].
The BGP Security Vulnerabilities
are analyzed in [<A HREF="node41_ct.html#idr-bgp-vuln" TARGET="contents">125</A>].

<P>
Two main solutions for securing BGP have emerged:
Protocol <B>S-BGP (<SPAN CLASS="arabic">29</SPAN>)</B>, Secure BGP, ([<A HREF="node41_ct.html#clynn-s-bgp-protocol" TARGET="contents">111</A>])
and
Protocol <B>soBGP (<SPAN CLASS="arabic">30</SPAN>)</B>, Secure Origin BGP, ([<A HREF="node41_ct.html#ng-sobgp-bgp-extensions" TARGET="contents">133</A>]).

<P>
S-BGP addresses seven security goals:

<P>

<OL>
<LI>Each update received by a BGP speaker from a
    peer was sent by the indicated peer and was not
    modified en-route from the peer.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Each update contains routing information no
    less recent than the routing information previously
    received for the indicated prefixes from that peer.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The update was intended for receipt by the peer
  that received it.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The peer that sent the update was authorized to
    advertise the routing information contained within
    the update.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The entity with the right to use an address
    space corresponding to a reachable prefix
    advertised in an update was given custodianship of
    that address space by a higher-level/parent entity.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The originating Domain was authorized, by the
    entity(s) with the right to use address space
    corresponding to the set of reachable prefixes, to
    advertise those prefixes.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>If the update indicates a withdrawn route, then
    the peer withdrawing the route was a legitimate
    advertiser for that route, prior to its withdrawal.

<P>
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
soBGP addresses two security goals:

<P>

<OL>
<LI>Is the Domain originating the destination
    authorized to advertise it? In other words, if a
    router receives an advertisement for the <EM>dest</EM>
    network originating in <EM>advertiser</EM>, is there
    any way to verify that <EM>advertiser</EM> is supposed
    to be advertising <EM>dest</EM>?

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Does the Domain advertising the destination
    actually have a path to the destination? In other
    words, if a router is receiving an advertisement
    from <EM>advertiser</EM> that it can reach <EM>dest</EM>,
    is there any way to verify that <EM>advertiser</EM>
    actually has a path to the Domain <EM>dest</EM>?

<P>
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
To achieve those goals, Authentication is also
necessary.

<P>
<EM>In summary, both Protocol S-BGP and
Protocol soBGP should provide Authentication, 3P-Authorization, and a property that may be expressed as a Temporal Formula&nbsp;
<BR>[1](G1,
<BR>[1]2,
<BR>[1]6,
<BR>[1]12,
<BR>[1]20).</EM>
