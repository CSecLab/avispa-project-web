Hi Tseno,

There is no special instruction for updating a value in a set.
But you can easily do it by combining de deletion and an addition.

For example, you can write:

  ...
  /\ in(C.K_CS.D1',KeyRing)
  =|>
  ...
  /\ KeyRing':=delete(C.K_CS.D1',KeyRing)
  /\ D2' := data_c2
  /\ KeyRing':=cons(C.K_CS.D2',KeyRing)

In this example (based on yours), the "in" predicate in the left-hand
side permits to check that the element to change really exists.
In the right-hand side, there is the deletion of the existing element,
and the addition of the new one.

Note that in this example, I have assumed that C and K_CS are known by
the agent, and that the third component was unknown (so written D1').
This was just for avoiing a too simple example... ;)

Does this example fully solve your problem?

Best,
Laurent.

PS: You can also replace the last two lines of the example by:
  /\ KeyRing':=cons(C.K_CS.data_c2,KeyRing)

                         ***********************



BACKGROUND AND SCOPE
====================

In connection with

	       The Second Workshop on Automated Reasoning
		     for Security Protocol Analysis
			       (ARSPA'05)

which took place as a satellite event of ICALP'05, we are guest-editing
a Special Issue of Theoretical Computer Science devoted to original
papers on formal security protocol specification, analysis and
verification.

Contributions are welcomed on the following topics and related ones:

- Automated analysis and verification of security protocols.
- Languages, logics, and calculi for the design and specification of
   security protocols.
- Verification methods: accuracy, efficiency.
- Decidability and complexity of cryptographic verification problems.
- Synthesis and composition of security protocols.
- Integration of formal security specification, refinement and
   validation techniques in development methods and tools.



SUBMISSION
==========

Authors should submit their papers electronically, in portable
document format (pdf) or postscript (ps), by sending an email with
subject "TCS submission" to the address
                         arspa -at- avispa-project.org
with the file of the paper as an attachment, by November 13, 2005.
The following information should be included in the body of the email,
in plain text:

Dear AVISPA users,

I am a new user of AVISPA and using the Web based version. I am looking for a detail user manual of HLPSL. I have already downloaded Deliverable 2.1. I have found some keywords in the examples of Deliverable 6.2 which are not listed in the manual I have downloaded. Is there any other helpful document? 

Thank you and regards,

Try downloading the AVISPA package, if I remember correctly it contains 
the necessary documentation.

Hello:
Has anyone tried to verify an onion routing protocol?  If so, what were
the obstacles you faced?  Can someone please send me a sample if
available?  I would appreciate it.

Thanks!
Meron

Dear Meron,

We did not model any onion router protocol yet.
This is indeed a very interesting challenge, but I guess that for this
you have to face the problem of specifying a dynamic network, right?
(no predefined number of nodes)

You can ask this question to the users mailing list of the AVISPA tool
(avispa-users@avispa-project.org) in case someone has already tried to
do this.

Sincerely,

Laurent.

As far as  I can  remember  in the following paper 
there is an approximated solution  of your problem 
(an onion has few slices!)  that  can also be applied  
with avispa tool.
