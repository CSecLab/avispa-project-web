<PRE>Hello Martin,

&gt;<i> I don't see how attacker i can get to the request() without passing  
</I>&gt;<i> through the witness().
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Specifically, I don't understand the following attack trace:
</I>&gt;<i> In (2) S creates a new nonce Ns (here Ns(5)). In (3) the message  
</I>&gt;<i> containing the nonce is accepted by C. Here witness(Ns(5)) should  
</I>&gt;<i> be called. In (4) a message encrypted with the session key Ksc  
</I>&gt;<i> between S and C is sent back to S. The message contains the nonce Ns 
</I>&gt;<i> (5). In (5) this message is accepted by S and here request(Ns(5))  
</I>&gt;<i> should be called. Why is this unsafe?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I assume that in the state/event dump the later events are at the  
</I>&gt;<i> top. Thus I have towards the end
</I>&gt;<i> an event
</I>&gt;<i> 	request(s,c,s_c_ns,Ns(5),3)
</I>&gt;<i> as expected. What does &quot;,3)&quot; mean?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Going down I also see
</I>&gt;<i> 	witness(c,i,s_c_ns,Ns(5))
</I>&gt;<i> which seems to be the corresponding witness event.
</I>&gt;<i> Is the reason for the UNSAFE result that this witness event  
</I>&gt;<i> contains &quot;i&quot; instead of &quot;s&quot;?
</I>&gt;<i> If so, why did ofmc put an &quot;i&quot; there in step (3) even so the  
</I>&gt;<i> message in reality came from s in step (2) and i can not have  
</I>&gt;<i> learned Ns(5) as the message is encrypted with Kc which i doesn't  
</I>&gt;<i> know.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Well, you do not show your environment role in which the sessions are  
specified, but the problem here is not that the attacker &quot;gets to&quot;  
the request without passing through the witness.  You should instead  
think about it as follows: the transitions define the behaviour of  
the honest agents.  The intruder's behaviour is not defined by these  
transitions, but by a standard set of rules that define what he can  
and can't do.

So: the problem is indeed that the witness contains &quot;i&quot; instead of  
&quot;s&quot;, and what this MEANS is that in one session, &quot;c&quot; believes that he  
is speaking with &quot;i&quot;.  So this is a problem of authentication.  &quot;s&quot;  
believes he is speaking with &quot;c&quot;, but that same &quot;c&quot; actually wants to  
talk to &quot;i&quot;.  This scenario must be included in your environment role.

Hope this helps,
Paul.
