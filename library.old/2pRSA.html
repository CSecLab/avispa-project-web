<P>
Issues abstracted from:
<UL>
<LI> General public/private keys instead of RSA exponentiation
<LI> Only MCS,HCS (client starts signing process)
</UL>
<P>
Currently, algebraic equations involving exponentiation exp and its inverse,
inv, cannot be handled. Therefore we use general public/private keys.

&nbsp;<BR><BR><DT><B>NOTES:</B> <DD> <BR>
The protocol uses the RSA-based signature scheme for signing a message by
including a 3rd trusted party (Server) in the signing process.
The RSA algorithm defines a modulus N and two exponents e,d such that
<TT>m^(ed) = m modulo EulerFct(N)</TT>. Here, e is the publicly known encryption
exponent and d the corresponding secret decryption exponent.
The signature of a message m is obtained by computing <TT>m^d</TT>.
The basic idea now is to split d into dc,ds with <TT>dc*ds = d modulo EulerFct(N)</TT>
and to give ds to the server and dc to the client.
For computing a signature the client first signs with his part of d yielding
<TT>m^dc</TT> and thereafter the server signs the result with ds yielding
<TT>(m^dc)^ds = m^d</TT>. Of course, the signing may also be performed the 
 other way round: first server then client.
Any agent who knows e can check the signature by computing <TT>signature^e</TT> and
by checking if the result is the original message.
<P>
The original property is as follows: The (trusted) server S has taken part in
all complete signatures which the (possibly) bad client BC can produce.
We model the bad client BC as a normal (good) client.
Additionally, we define a consumer C to whom BC sends the original message M
together with the final signature SSM. 
The intruder may intercept and modify this last message (and thus play the 'bad'
part of BC).
The consumer checks if the signature really originated from the server S.
