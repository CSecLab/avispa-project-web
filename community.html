  <h2>The AVISPA-USERS community</h2>

  <h3>Overview</h3>

  <p>
  Since the release of the Avispa Tool, the Avispa community has been
  continuously growing. The tool itself has been used both for
  research and for teaching purposes in major academic institutes and
  research centres around the world.
  
  <p>
  Given that, it is our feeling that a mailing list alone does not
  suffice anymore, and that the community of those who actively use
  the Avispa Tool could be strengthened and hopefully enlarged by a
  community manager.

  <h3>Community manager</h3> 

  <p>
  First of all, the <b>Avispa Users community manager</b> allows its
  members to locate each other. Also, it allows the members to
  maintain a web page where they can explain the use they make of the
  Avispa Tool and/or show the results they obtained, and so
  on. Indeed, it is a more powerful and expressive way to advertise
  the own results and to share them with the other members of the
  community.


  <h3>Subscribing</h3>
