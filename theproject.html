    <h2>This is AVISPA:</h2>

    AVISPA aims at developing a push-button, industrial-strength
    technology for the analysis of large-scale Internet security-sensitive
    protocols and applications. This technology will speed up the development
    of the next generation of network protocols, improve their security, and
    therefore increase the public acceptance of advanced, distributed IT
    applications based on them.<p>

    We at AVISPA will achieve this by advancing specification and deduction
    technology to the point where industry protocols can be specified and
    automatically analyzed.<p>

    A central aim of the project is then to integrate this technology into
    a robust automated tool, tuned on practical, large-scale problems, and
    migrated to standardization bodies, whose protocol designers are in dire
    need of such tools.<p>

    <h2>Objectives</h2>

    <ol type=i>
      <li> to develop a rich specification language for formalizing protocols,
           security goals, and threat models of industrial complexity
      <li> to advance the state-of-the-art in automated deduction techniques to
           scale up to this complexity
      <li> to build a tool based on these techniques that will allow industry
           and standardization organizations to automatically validate or
           detect errors in their products
      <li> to tune this tool and demonstrate proof-of-concept on a large collection
           of practically relevant, industrial protocols
      <li> to begin the migration of this technology into industry standardization
           organizations such as the IETF so that both the scientific and the
           industrial community can benefit from the advances achieved by this
           project.

    <h2>Funding</h2>

    AVISPA is a shared-cost RTD (FET open) project, funded by
    <a href="http://europa.eu.int/comm" target="_blank">the European Commission</a>
    under the
    <a href="http://www.cordis.lu/ist" target="_blank">Information Society Technologies Programme</a>
    operating within the
    <a href="http://www.cordis.lu/fp5" target="_blank">Fifth Framework Programme</a>,
    started on January 1st, 2003.

    <h3>The AVISS project</h3>

    AVISS (Automated Validation of Infinite-State Systems) is the
    assessment project which has paved the way for AVISPA.
    Started in May, 2001 and lasted for one year, it has proved to
    be successful and it has boosted the interest both in the topic
    and in the research group.<p>

    AVISPA is the result of the follow-up grant proposal, which was
    accepted in Summer 2002.<p>
